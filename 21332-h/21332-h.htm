      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the title-page of this volume indicates, no more is here attempted than
      a memorial of Charles Dickens in association with his Readings. It
      appeared desirable that something in the shape of an accurate record
      should be made of an episode in many respects so remarkable in the career
      of the most popular author of his generation. A commemorative volume,
      precisely of this character, was projected by the writer in the spring of
      1870. Immediately after the Farewell Reading in St James's Hall, on the
      15th of March, Charles Dickens wrote, in hearty approval of the
      suggestion, &ldquo;Everything that I can let you have in aid of the proposed
      record (which, <i>of course</i>, would be far more agreeable to me if done
      by you than by any other hand) shall be at your service.&rdquo; All the
      statistics, he added, should be placed freely at the writer's command; all
      the marked books from which he himself read should be confided to him for
      reference. In now realising his long-postponed intention, the writer's
      endeavour has been throughout to restrict the purpose of his book as much
      as possible to matters either directly or indirectly affecting these
      famous Readings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Biography of Charles Dickens having been undertaken by the oldest and
      dearest of his friends, all that is here attempted is to portray, as
      accurately as may be, a single phase in the career and character of one of
      the greatest of all our English Humorists. What is thus set forth has the
      advantage, at any rate, of being penned from the writer's own intimate
      knowledge. With the Novelist's career as a Reader he has been familiar
      throughout. From its beginning to its close he has regarded it
      observantly. He has viewed it both from before and from behind the scenes,
      from the front of the house as well as from within the shelter of the
      screen upon the platform. When contrasted with the writings of the
      Master-Humorist, these readings of his, though so remarkable in
      themselves, shrink, no doubt, to comparative insignificance. But simply
      considering them as supplementary, and, certainly, as very exceptional,
      evidences of genius on the part of a great author, they may surely be
      regarded as having been worthy of the keenest scrutiny at the time, and
      entitled afterwards to some honest commemoration.

    <h1>
      CHARLES DICKENS AS A READER.
    </h1>
    <p>
      A celebeated writer is hardly ever capable as a Reader of doing justice to
      his own imaginings. Dr. Johnson's whimsical anecdote of the author of The
      Seasons admits, in point of fact, of a very general application. According
      to the grimly humorous old Doctor, &ldquo;He [Thomson] was once reading to
      Doddington, who, being himself a reader eminently elegant, was so much
      provoked by his odd utterance, that he snatched the paper from his hand,
      and told him that he did not understand his own verses!&rdquo; Dryden, again,
      when reading his Amphytrion in the green-room, &ldquo;though,&rdquo; says Cibber, who
      was present upon the occasion, &ldquo;he delivered the plain meaning of every
      period, yet the whole was in so cold, so flat, and unaffecting a manner,
      that I am afraid of not being believed when I affirm it.&rdquo; Elsewhere, in
      his Apology, when contrasting the creator with the interpreter, the
      original delineator with the actual impersonator of character, the same
      old stage gossip remarks, how men would read Shakspere with higher rapture
      could they but conceive how he was played by Betterton! &ldquo;Then might they
      know,&rdquo; he exclaims, with a delightful extravagance of emphasis and
      quaint-ness of phraseology, &ldquo;the one was born alone to speak what the
      other only knew to write!&rdquo; The simple truth of the matter being that for
      the making of a consummate actor, reader, or impersonator, not only is
      there required, to begin with, a certain histrionic instinct or dramatic
      aptitude, but a combination&mdash;very rarely to be met with, indeed&mdash;of
      personal gifts, of physical peculiarities, of vocal and facial, nay, of
      subtly and yet instantly appreciable characteristics. Referring merely to
      those who are skilled as conversationalists, Sir Richard Steele remarks,
      very justly, in the <i>Spectator</i> (No. 521), that, &ldquo;In relations, the
      force of the expression lies very often more in the look, the tone of
      voice, or the gesture, than in the words themselves, which, being repeated
      in any other manner by the undiscerning, bear a very different
      interpretation from their original meaning.&rdquo; Whatever is said as to all
      that is requisite in the delivery of an oration by the master of all
      oratory, applies with equal distinctness to those who are readers or
      actors professionally. All depends on the countenance, is the <i>dictum</i>
      of Cicero,{*} and even in that, he says, the eyes bear sovereign sway.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * De Oratore iii., 59.
</pre>
    <p>
      Elsewhere, in his great treatise, referring to what was all-essential in
      oratorical delivery, according to Demosthenes, Tully, by a bold and
      luminous phrase, declares Action to be, as it were, the speech of the
      body,&mdash;&ldquo;quasi sermo corporis.&rdquo; Voice, eyes, bearing, gesture,
      countenance, each in turn, all of them together, are to the spoken words,
      or, rather than that, it should be said, to the thoughts and emotions of
      which those articulate sounds are but the winged symbols, as to the barbed
      and feathered arrows are the bowstring. How essential every external of
      this kind is, as affording some medium of communication between a speaker
      and his auditors, may be illustrated upon the instant by the rough and
      ready argument of the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. Without insisting, for
      example, upon the impossibility of having a speech delivered by one who is
      actually blind, and deaf, and dumb, we need only imagine here its
      utterance, by some wall-eyed stammerer, who has a visage about as wooden
      and inexpressive as the figure-head of a merchantman. Occasionally, it is
      true, physical defects have been actually conquered, individual
      peculiarities have been in a great measure counteracted, by rhetorical
      artifice, or by the arts of oratorical delivery: instance the lisp of
      Demosthenes, the stutter of Fox, the brogue of Burke, and the burr of
      Brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, but very rarely, it has so happened that an actor of nearly
      peerless excellence, that a reader of all but matchless power, has
      achieved his triumphs, has acquired his reputation, in very despite of
      almost every conceivable personal disadvantage. Than the renowned actor
      already mentioned, for example, Thomas Betterton, a more radiant name has
      hardly ever been inscribed upon the roll of English players, from Burbage
      to Garrick. Yet what is the picture of this incomparable tragedian, drawn
      by one who knew him and who has described his person for us minutely,
      meaning Antony Aston, in his theatrical pamphlet, called the Brief
      Supplement? Why it is absolutely this,&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Betterton,&rdquo; says his
      truthful panegyrist, &ldquo;although a superlative good actor, laboured under an
      ill figure, being clumsily made, having a great head, a short, thick neck,
      stooped in the shoulders, and had fat, short arms, which he rarely lifted
      higher than his stomach. He had little eyes and a broad face, a little
      pock-fretten, a corpulent body, and thick legs, with large feet. His voice
      was low and grumbling. He was incapable of dancing, even in a country
      dance.&rdquo; And so forth! Yet this was the consummate actor who was regarded
      by the more discerning among his contemporaries, but most of all by the
      brother actors who were immediately around him, as simply inimitable and
      unapproachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was John Henderson, again, great in his time, both as a tragic and a
      comic actor, greatest of all as a reader or an impersonator. Hear him
      described by one who has most carefully and laboriously written his
      encomium, that is to say, by John Ireland, his biographer. What do we read
      of him? That in height he was below the common standard, that his frame
      was uncompacted, that his limbs were short and ill-proportioned, that his
      countenance had little of that flexibility which anticipates the tongue,
      that his eye had scarcely anything of that language which, by preparing
      the spectator for the coming sentence, enchains the attention, that his
      voice was neither silvery nor mellifluous. Nevertheless, by a subtlety of
      discrimination, that seemed almost intuitive, by a force of judgment and a
      fervency of mind, that were simply exquisite and irresistible, this was
      the very man who could at any moment, by an inflection of his voice or by
      the syncope of a chuckle, move his audience at pleasure to tears or to
      laughter. He could haunt their memories for years afterwards with the
      infinite tenderness of his ejaculation as Hamlet, of &ldquo;The fair Ophelia!&rdquo;
       He could convulse them with merriment by his hesitating utterance as
      Falstaff of &ldquo;A shirt&mdash;and a half!&rdquo; Incidentally it is remarked by the
      biographer of Henderson that the qualifications requisite to constitute a
      reader of especial excellence seem to be these, &ldquo;a good ear, a voice
      capable of inflexion, an understanding of, and taste for, the beauties of
      the author.&rdquo; Added to this, there must be, of course, a feeling, an
      ardour, an enthusiasm sufficient at all times to ensure their rapid and
      vivid manifestation. Richly endowed in this way, however, though Henderson
      was, his gifts were weighted, as we have seen were those also of
      Betterton, by a variety of physical defects, some of which were almost
      painfully conspicuous. Insomuch was this the case, in the latter instance,
      that Tony Aston has oddly observed, in regard to the all but peerless
      tragedian, &ldquo;He was better to meet than to follow; for his aspect [the
      writer evidently means, here, when met] was serious, venerable, and
      majestic; in his latter time a little paralytic.&rdquo; Accepting at once as
      reasonable and as accurate what has thus been asserted by those who have
      made the art of elocution their especial and chosen study for analysis, it
      is surely impossible not to recognise at a glance how enormously a reader
      must, by necessity, be advantaged, who, in addition to the intellectual
      and emotional gifts already enumerated, possesses those personal
      attributes and physical endowments in which a reader, otherwise of
      surpassing excellence, like Henderson, and an actor, in other respects of
      incomparable ability, like Betterton, was each in turn so glaringly
      deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever is here said in regard to Charles Dickens, it should be borne in
      mind, is written and published during the lifetime of his own immediate
      contemporaries. He himself, his readings, the sound of his voice, the ring
      of his footstep, the glance of his eye, are all still vividly within the
      recollection of the majority of those who will examine the pages of this
      memorial. Everything, consequently, which is set forth in them is penned
      with a knowledge of its inevitable revision or endorsement by the reader's
      own personal remembrance. It is in the full glare of that public
      remembrance that the present writer refers to the great novelist as an
      impersonator of his more remarkable creations. Everybody who has seen him,
      who has heard him, who has carefully watched him, though it may be but at
      a single one of these memorable readings, will recognise at a glance the
      accuracy or the inaccuracy of the delineation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is observable, in the first instance, in regard to Charles Dickens,
      that he had in an extraordinary degree the dramatic element in his
      character. It was an integral part of his individuality. It coloured his
      whole temperament or idiosyncracy. Unconsciously he described himself, to
      a T, in Nicholas Nickleby. &ldquo;There's genteel comedy in your walk and
      manner, juvenile tragedy in your eye, and touch-and-go farce in your
      la'ugh,&rdquo; might have been applied to himself in his buoyant youth quite as
      readily and directly as to Nicholas. The author, rather than the hero of
      Nickleby, seems, in that happy utterance of the theatrical manager, to
      have been photographed. It cannot but now be apparent that, as an
      unpremeditated preliminary to Dickens's then undreamt-of career as a
      reader of his own works in public and professionally, the Private
      Theatricals over which he presided during several years in his own home
      circle as manager, prepared the way no less directly than his occasional
      Readings, later on, at some expense to himself (in travelling and
      otherwise) for purely charitable purposes. His proclivity stagewards, in
      effect, the natural trending of his line of life, so to speak, in the
      histrionic or theatrical direction, was, in another way, indicated at a
      yet earlier date, and not one jot less pointedly. It was so, we mean, at
      the very opening of his career in authorship, when having just sprung into
      precocious celebrity as the writer of the Sketches and of the earlier
      numbers of Pickwick, he contributed an opera and a couple of farces with
      brilliant success to the boards of the St. James's Theatre. Braham and
      Parry and Hullah winged with melody the words of &ldquo;The Village Coquettes;&rdquo;
       while the quaint humour of Harley excited roars of laughter through the
      whimsicalities of &ldquo;Is She His Wife?&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Strange Gentleman.&rdquo; Trifles
      light as air though these effusions might be, the radiant bubbles showed
      even then, as by a casual freak which way with him the breeze in his
      leisure hours was drifting. A dozen years or more after this came the
      private theatricals at Tavistock House. Beginning simply, first of all,
      with his direction of his children's frolics in the enacting of a
      burletta, of a Cracker Bonbon for Christmas, and of one of Planché's
      charming fairy extravaganzas, these led up in the end through what must be
      called circuitously Dickens's emendations of O'Hara's version of
      Fielding's burlesque of &ldquo;Tom Thumb,&rdquo; to the manifestation of the
      novelist's remarkable genius for dramatic impersonation: first of all, as
      Aaron Gurnock in Wilkie Collins's &ldquo;Lighthouse,&rdquo; and afterwards as Richard
      War dour in the same author's &ldquo;Frozen Deep.&rdquo; Already he had achieved
      success, some years earlier, as an amateur performer in characters not
      essentially his own, as, for example, in the representation of the senile
      blandness of Justice Shallow, or of the gasconading humours of Captain
      Bobadil. Just, as afterwards, in furtherance of the interests of the Guild
      of Literature and Art, he impersonated Lord Wilmot in Lytton's comedy of
      &ldquo;Not so Bad as we Seem,&rdquo; and represented in a series of wonderfully rapid
      transformations the protean person of Mr. Gabblewig, through the medium of
      a delightful farce called &ldquo;Mr. Nightingale's Diary.&rdquo; Whoever witnessed
      Dickens's impersonation of Mr. Gabblewig, will remember that it included a
      whole cluster of grotesque creations of his own. Among these there was a
      stone-deaf old man, who, whenever he was shouted at, used to sigh out
      resignedly, &ldquo;Ah, it's no use your whispering!&rdquo; Besides whom there was a
      garrulous old lady, in herself the worthy double of Mrs. Gamp; a sort of
      half-brother to Sam Weller; and an alternately shrieking and apologetic
      valetudinarian, who was, perhaps, the most whimsical of them all. Nothing
      more, however, need here be said in regard to Charles Dickens's share,
      either in these performances for the Guild or in the other strictly
      private theatricals. They are simply here referred to, as having prepared
      the way by practice, for the Readings, still so called, though, in all
      save costume and general <i>mis en scene</i>, they were from first to last
      essentially and intensely dramatic representations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Readings of this character, it is curious to reflect for a moment,
      resemble somewhat in the simplicity of their surroundings the habitual
      stage arrangements of the days of Shakspere. The arena, in each instance,
      might be described accurately enough as a platform, draped with screens
      and hangings of cloth or of green baize. The principal difference, in
      point of fact, between the two would be apparent in this, that whereas, in
      the one case any reasonable number of performers might be grouped together
      simultaneously, in the other there would remain from first to last before
      the audience but one solitary performer. He, however, as a mere matter of
      course, by the very necessity of his position, would have to be regarded
      throughout as though he were a noun of multitude signifying many. Slashed
      doublets and trunk hose, might just possibly be deemed by some more
      picturesque, if not in outline, at least in colour and material, than the
      evening costume of now-a-days. But, apart from this, whatever would meet
      the gaze of the spectator in either instance would bear the like aspect of
      familiarity or of incongruity, in contrast to or in association with, the
      characters represented at the moment before actual contemporaries. These
      later performances partake, of course, in some sense of the nature of a
      monologue. Besides which, they involve the display of a desk and a book
      instead of the almost ludicrous exhibition of a board inscribed, as the
      case might be, &ldquo;Syracuse&rdquo; or &ldquo;Verona.&rdquo; Apart from this, however, a modern
      reading is, in the very nature of it, like a reverting to the primitive
      simplicity of the stage, when the stage, in its social influences, was at
      its highest and noblest, when, for the matter of that, it was all but
      paramount. Given genius in the author and in the impersonator, and that
      very simplicity has its enormous advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest of all the law-givers of art in this later civilisation has
      more than merely hinted at what is here maintained. Goethe has said
      emphatically, in Wilhelm Meister, that a really good actor makes us soon
      enough forget the awkwardness, even the meanness, of trumpery decorations;
      whereas, he continues, a magnificent theatre is precisely the very thing
      that makes us feel the most keenly the want of actors of real excellence.
      How wisely in this Goethe, according to his wont, has spoken, we all of
      us, here in England, know by our own experience. Of the truth of his
      opinion we have had in this country, of late years, more than one
      startling illustration. Archaeological knowledge, scenic illusion,
      gorgeous upholstery, sumptuous costumes, have, in the remembrance of many,
      been squandered in profusion upon the boards of one of our London theatres
      in the getting up of a drama by the master-dramatist. All this has tended,
      however, only to realise the more painfully the inadequacy of the powers,
      no less of the leading star than of his whole company, to undertake the
      interpretation of the dramatic masterpiece. The spectacle which we are
      viewing in such an instance is, no doubt, resplendent; but it is so purely
      as a spectacle. Everything witnessed is&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;So coldly sweet, so deadly fair,
     We start, for soul is wanting there.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The result naturally is, that the public is disillusioned and that the
      management is bankrupt. Another strikingly-contrasted experience of the
      present generation is this, that, without any decorations whatever,
      enormous audiences have been assembled together, in the old world and in
      the new, upon every occasion upon which they have been afforded the
      opportunity, to hear a story related by the lips of the writer of it. And
      they have been so assembled not simply because the story itself (every
      word of it known perfectly well beforehand) was worth hearing again, or
      because there was a very natural curiosity to behold the famous author by
      whom it had been penned; but, above all, because his voice, his glance,
      his features, his every movement, his whole person, gave to his thoughts
      and his emotions, whether for tears or for laughter, the most vivid
      interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it happened, in this instance, that a writer of celebrity like Charles
      Dickens became a reader of his own works before large public audiences may
      be readily explained. Before his first appearance in that character
      professionally&mdash;that is, as a public reader, on his own account&mdash;he
      had enjoyed more than twenty years of unexampled popularity as a novelist.
      During that period he had not only securely established his reputation in
      authorship, but had evidenced repeatedly, at intervals during the later
      portion of it, histrionic powers hardly less remarkable in their way than
      those gifts which had previously won for him his wholly exceptional fame
      as a writer of imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among his personal intimates, among all those who knew him best, it had
      long come to be recognised that his skill as an impersonator was only
      second to his genius as a creator of humorous and pathetic character. His
      success in each capacity sprang from his intense sympathy and his equally
      intense earnestness. Whatever with him was worth doing at all, was worth
      doing thoroughly. Anything he undertook, no matter what, he went in at,
      according to the good old sea phrase, with a will. He always endeavoured
      to accomplish whatever had to be accomplished as well as it could possibly
      be effected within the reach of his capabilities. Whether it were pastime
      or whether it were serious business, having once taken anything in hand,
      he applied to it the whole of his energies. Hence, as an amateur actor, he
      was simply unapproachable. He passed, in fact, beyond the range of mere
      amateurs, and was brought into contrast by right, with the most gifted
      professionals among his contemporaries. Hence, again, as an after-dinner
      speaker, he was nothing less than incomparable. &ldquo;He spoke so well,&rdquo;
       Anthony Trollope has remarked, &ldquo;that a public dinner became a blessing
      instead of a curse if he were in the chair&mdash;had its compensating
      twenty minutes of pleasure, even if he were called upon to propose a toast
      or thank the company for drinking his health.&rdquo; He did nothing by halves,
      but everything completely. How completely he gave himself up to the
      delivery of a speech or of a reading, Mr. Arthur Helps has summed up in
      less than a dozen words of singular emphasis. That keen observer has said,
      indeed quite truly, of Dickens,&mdash;&ldquo;When he read or spoke, the whole
      man read or spoke.&rdquo; It was thus with him repeatedly, and always
      delightfully, in mere chance conversation. An incident related by him
      often became upon the instant a little acted drama. His mimetic powers
      were in many respects marvellous. In voice, in countenance, in carriage,
      almost, it might be said, at moments, in stature, he seemed to be a
      Proteus.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to a curious account which has been happily preserved for us in
      the memoirs of the greatest reader of the last century, Henderson first of
      all exhibited his elocutionary skill by reciting (it was at Islington) an
      Ode on Shakspere. So exactly did he deliver this in Garrick's manner, that
      the acutest ear failed to distinguish the one from the other. One of those
      present declared, years afterwards, that he was certain the speaker <i>must
      be</i> either Garrick or Antichrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imitative powers not one iota less extraordinary in their way were, at any
      moment, seemingly, at the command of the subject of this memorial. In one
      or two instances that might be named the assumption was all but identity.
      An aptitude of this particular kind, as everyone can appreciate upon the
      instant, would by necessity come wonderfully in aid of the illusive effect
      produced by readings that were in point of fact the mere vehicle or medium
      for a whole crowd of vivid impersonations. Anyone, moreover, possessing
      gifts like these, of a very peculiar description, not only naturally but
      inevitably enjoys himself every opportunity that may arise for displaying
      them to those about him, to his friends and intimates. &ldquo;Man is of a
      companionable, conversing nature,&rdquo; says Goethe in his novel of The
      Renunciants, &ldquo;his delight is great when he exercises faculties that have
      been given him, even though nothing further came of it.&rdquo; Seeing that
      something further readily did come of it in the instance of Charles
      Dickens, it can hardly be matter for surprise that the readings and
      impersonations which were first of all a home delight, should at length
      quite naturally have opened up before the popular author what was for him
      an entirely new, but at the same time a perfectly legitimate, career
      professionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recitations or readings of his own works in public by a great writer are,
      in point of fact, as old as literature itself. They date back to the very
      origin of polite letters, both prose and poetic. It matters nothing
      whether there was one Homer, or whether there may have been a score of
      Homers, so far as the fact of oral publication applies to the Iliad and
      the Odyssey, nearly a thousand years (900) before the foundation of
      Christianity. By the lips of a single bard, or of a series of bards,
      otherwise of public declaimers or reciters, the world was first
      familiarised with the many enthralling tales strung together in those
      peerless masterpieces. Again, at a period of very nearly five hundred
      years (484) before the epoch of the Redemption, the Father of History came
      to lay the foundation, as it were, of the whole fabric of prose literature
      in a precisely similar manner&mdash;that is to say, by public readings or
      recitations. In point of fact, the instance there is more directly akin to
      the present argument. A musical cadence, or even possibly an instrumental
      accompaniment, may have marked the Homeric chant about Achilles and
      Ulysses. Whereas, obviously, in regard to Herodotus, the readings given by
      him at the Olympic games were readings in the modern sense, pure and
      simple. Lucian has related the incident, not only succinctly, but
      picturesquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herodotus, then in his fiftieth year, reflected for a long while seriously
      how he might, with the least trouble and in the shortest time, win for
      himself and his writings a large amount of glory and reputation. Shrinking
      from the fatigue involved in the labour of visiting successively one after
      another the chief cities of the Athenians, the Corinthians, and the
      Lacedæmonians, he ingeniously hit upon the notion of appearing in person
      at the Olympian Games, and of there addressing himself simultaneously to
      the very pick and flower of the whole Greek population. Providing himself
      beforehand with the choicest portions or select passages from his great
      narrative, he there read or declaimed those fragments of his History to
      the assembled multitude from the stage or platform of the theatre. And he
      did this, moreover, with such an evident captivation about him, not only
      in the style of his composition, but in the very manner of its delivery,
      that the applause of his hearers interrupted him repeatedly&mdash;the
      close of these recitations by the great author-reader being greeted with
      prolonged and resounding acclamations. Nay, not only are these particulars
      related as to the First Reading recorded as having been given by a Great
      Author, but, further than that, there is the charming incident described
      of Thucydides, then a boy of fifteen, listening entranced among the
      audience to the heroic occurrences recounted by the sonorous and
      impassioned voice of the annalist, and at the climax of it all bursting
      into tears. Lucian's comment upon that earliest Reading might, with a
      change of names, be applied almost word for word to the very latest of
      these kinds of intellectual exhibitions. &ldquo;None were ignorant,&rdquo; he says,
      &ldquo;of the name of Herodotus; nor was there a single person in Greece who had
      not either seen him at the Olympics, or heard those speak of him that came
      from thence: so that in what place soever he came the inhabitants pointed
      with their finger, saying 'This is that Herodotus who has written the
      Persian Wars in the Ionic dialect, this is he who has celebrated our
      victories.' Thus the harvest which he reaped from his histories was, the
      receiving in one assembly the general applause of all Greece, and the
      sounding his fame, not only in one place and by a single trumpet, but by
      as many mouths as there had been spectators in that assembly.&rdquo; As recently
      as within these last two centuries, indeed, both in the development of the
      career of Molière and in the writing of his biography by Voltaire, the
      whole question as to the propriety of a great author becoming the public
      interpreter of his own imaginings has been, not only discussed, but
      defined with precision and in the end authoritatively proclaimed.
      Voltaire, in truth, has significantly remarked, in his &ldquo;Vie de Molière,&rdquo;
       when referring to Poquelin's determination to become Comedian as well as
      Dramatist, that among the Athenians, as is perfectly well known, authors
      not only frequently performed in their own dramatic productions, but that
      none of them ever felt dishonoured by speaking gracefully in the presence
      and hearing of their fellow-citizens.{*}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;On sait que chez les Athéniens, les auteurs jouaient
     souvent dans leurs pieces, et qu'ils n'etoient point
     déshonorés pour parler avec grace devant leurs concitoyens.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In arriving at this decision, however, it will be remarked that one simple
      but important proviso or condition is indicated&mdash;not to be
      dishonoured they must speak with grace, that is, effectively. Whenever an
      author can do this, the fact is proclaimed by the public themselves. Does
      he lack the dramatic faculty, is he wanting in elocutionary skill, is his
      deliver dull, are his features inexpressive, is his manner tedious, are
      his readings marked only by their general tameness and mediocrity, be sure
      of this, he will speedily find himself talking only to empty benches, his
      enterprise will cease and determine, his name will no longer prove an
      attraction. Abortive adventures of this kind have in our own time been
      witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Charles Dickens's Readings it was entirely different. Attracting to
      themselves at the outset, by the mere glamour of his name, enormous
      audiences, they not only maintained their original <i>prestige</i> during
      a long series of years&mdash;during an interval of fifteen years
      altogether&mdash;but the audiences brought together by them, instead of
      showing any signs of diminution, very appreciably, on the contrary,
      increased and multiplied. Crowds were turned away from the doors, who were
      unable to obtain admittance. The last reading of all collected together
      the largest audience that has ever been assembled, that ever can by
      possibility be assembled for purely reading purposes, within the walls of
      St. James's Hall, Piccadilly. Densely packed from floor to ceiling, these
      audiences were habitually wont to hang in breathless expectation upon
      every inflection of the author-reader's voice, upon every glance of his
      eye,&mdash;the words he was about to speak being so thoroughly well
      remembered by the majority before their utterance that, often, the
      rippling of a smile over a thousand faces simultaneously anticipated the
      laughter which an instant afterwards greeted the words themselves when
      they were articulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, from first to last, there must have been considerably more
      than Four Hundred&mdash;very nearly, indeed, Five Hundred&mdash;of these
      Readings, each one among them in itself a memorable demonstration. Through
      their delightful agency, at the very outset, largess was scattered
      broadcast, abundantly, and with a wide open hand, among a great variety of
      recipients, whose interests, turn by turn, were thus exclusively
      subserved, at considerable labour to himself, during a period of several
      years, by this large-hearted entertainer. Eventually the time arrived when
      it became necessary to decide, whether an exhausting and unremunerative
      task should be altogether abandoned, or whether readings hitherto given
      solely for the benefit of others, should be thenceforth adopted as a
      perfectly legitimate source of income for himself professionally. The ball
      was at his feet: should it be rolled on, or fastidiously turned aside by
      reason of certain fantastic notions as to its derogating, in some
      inconceivable way, from the dignity of authorship? That was the
      alternative in regard to which Dickens had to decide, and upon which he at
      once, as became him, decided manfully. The ball was rolled on, and, as it
      rolled, grew in bulk like a snowball. It accumulated for him, as it
      advanced, and that too within a wonderfully brief interval, a very
      considerable fortune. It strengthened and extended his already
      widely-diffused and intensely personal popularity. By making him, thus,
      distinctly a Reader himself, it brought him face to face with vast
      multitudes of his own readers in the Old World and in the New, in all
      parts of the United Kingdom, and at last, upon the occasion of his second
      visit to America, an expedition adventured upon expressly to that end, in
      all parts of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these Readings were throughout so conspicuously and so radiantly a
      success, that even in the recollection of them, now that they are things
      of the past, it may be said that they have already beneficially
      influenced, and are still perceptibly advancing, the wider and keener
      appreciation of the writings themselves. In its gyrations the ball then
      rolling at the Reader's foot imparted a momentum to one far nobler and
      more lasting&mdash;that of the Novelist's reputation, one that in its
      movement gives no sign of slackening&mdash;&ldquo;labitur et labetur in omne
      volubilis sevum.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The long continuance of the remarkable success attendant upon the Readings
      all through, is only to be explained by the extraordinary care and
      earnestness the Reader lavished continuously upon his task when once it
      had been undertaken. In this he was only in another phase of his career,
      consistently true to the one simple rule adopted by him as an artist
      throughout. What that rule was anyone might see at a glance on turning
      over the leaves of one of his books, it matters not which, in the original
      manuscript. There, the countless alterations, erasures, interpolations,
      transpositions, interlineations, shew plainly enough the minute and
      conscientious thought devoted to the perfecting, so far as might be in any
      way possible, of the work of composition. What reads so unaffectedly and
      so felicitously, it is then seen, is but the result of exquisite
      consideration. It is Sheridan's whimsical line which declares that,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Easy writing's cursed hard reading.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And it is Pope who summarizes the method by which not &ldquo;easy writing&rdquo; but
      &ldquo;ease in writing&rdquo; is arrived at, where it is said of those who have
      acquired a mastery of the craft,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They polish all with so much life and ease, You think 'tis nature and a
      knack to please: But ease in writing flows from art, not chance; As those
      move easiest who have learn'd to dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Precisely the same elaboration of care, which all through his career was
      dedicated by Charles Dickens to the most delightful labour of his life,
      that of writing, was accorded by him to the lesser but still eminently
      intellectual toil of preparing his Readings for representation. It was not
      by any means that, having written a story years previously, he had, in his
      new capacity as a reciter, merely to select two or three chapters from it,
      and read them off with an air of animation. Virtually, the fragmentary
      portions thus taken from his larger works were re-written by him, with
      countless elisions and eliminations after having been selected. Reprinted
      in their new shape, each as &ldquo;A Reading,&rdquo; they were then touched and
      retouched by their author, pen in hand, until, at the end of a long
      succession of revisions, the pages came to be cobwebbed over with a
      wonderfully intricate network of blots and lines in the way of correction
      or of obliteration. Several of the leaves in this way, what with the black
      letter-press on the white paper, being scored out or interwoven with a
      tracery in red ink and blue ink alternately, present to view a curiously
      parti-coloured or tesselated appearance. As a specimen page, however, will
      afford a more vivid illustration upon the instant of what is referred to,
      than could be conveyed by any mere verbal description, a fac-simile is
      here introduced of a single page taken from the &ldquo;Reading of Little
      Dombey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever thought was lavished thus upon the composition of the Readings,
      was lavished quite as unstintingly upon the manner of their delivery.
      Thoroughly natural, impulsive, and seemingly artless, though that manner
      always appeared at the moment, it is due to the Reader as an artist to
      assert that it was throughout the result of a scarcely credible amount of
      forethought and preparation. It is thus invariably indeed with every great
      proficient in the histrionic art, even with those who are quite
      erroneously supposed by the outer public to trust nearly everything to the
      momentary impulses of genius, and who are therefore presumed to disdain
      anything whatever in the way either of forethought or of actual
      preparation by rehearsal.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to what is, even down to this present day, very generally
      conjectured, Edmund Kean, one of the greatest tragedians who ever trod the
      stage, is popularly imagined to have always played simply, as might be
      said, hap-hazard, trusting himself to the spur of the moment for throwing
      himself into a part passionately;&mdash;the fact being exactly the reverse
      in his regard, according to the earliest and most accurate of his
      biographers. Erratic, fitful though the genius of Edmund Kean
      unquestionably was&mdash;rendering him peerless as Othello, incomparable
      as Overreach&mdash;we are told in Mr. Procter's life of him, that &ldquo;he
      studied long and anxiously,&rdquo; frequently until many hours after
      midnight.{*} No matter what his occupations previously might have been, or
      how profound his exhaustion through rehearsing in the forenoon, and
      performing in the evening, and sharing in convivialities afterwards, Barry
      Cornwall relates of him that he would often begin to study when his family
      had retired for the night, practising in solitude, after he had
      transformed his drawing-room into a stage in miniature.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says his biographer, &ldquo;with a dozen candles, some on the floor,
      some on the table, and some on the chimney-piece, and near the pier-glass,
      he would act scene after scene: considering the emphasis, the modulation
      of the verse, and the fluctuations of the character with the greatest
      care.&rdquo; And this, remember, has relation to one who was presumably about
      the most spontaneous and impulsive actor who ever flashed meteor-like
      across the boards of a theatre. Whoever has the soul of an artist grudges
      no labour given to his art, be he reader or actor, author or tragedian.
      Charles Dickens certainly spared none to his Readings in his conscientious
      endeavour to give his own imaginings visible and audible embodiment. The
      sincerity of his devotion to his task, when once it had been taken in
      hand, was in its way something remarkable.

    <p>
      As illustrative of her meaning in which phrase, she then adds, &ldquo;John
      Kemble and Mrs. Siddons were always in earnest in what they were about;
      Miss O'Neil used to cry bitterly in all her tragic parts; whilst Garrick
      could be making faces and playing tricks in the middle of his finest
      points, and Kean would talk gibberish while the people were in an uproar
      of applause at his.&rdquo; Fanny Kemble further remarks: &ldquo;In my own individual
      instance, I know that sometimes I could turn every word I am saying into
      burlesque,&rdquo;&mdash;immediately observing here, in a reverential parenthesis
      &ldquo;(never Shakspere, by-the-bye)&mdash;and at others my heart aches and I
      cry real, bitter, warm tears as earnestly as if I was in earnest.&rdquo; Reading
      which last sentence, one might very safely predicate that in the one
      instance, where she could turn her words into burlesque, she would be
      certain to act but indifferently, whereas in the other, with the hot,
      scalding tears running down her face, she could not by necessity do
      otherwise than act to admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thorough and consistent throughout his reading career was the sincerity
      of Dickens in his impersonations, that his words and looks, his thoughts
      and emotions were never mere make-believes, but always, so far as the most
      vigilant eye or the most sensitive ear could detect, had their full and
      original significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all respect for Miss O'Neil's emotion, and for that candidly
      confessed to by Mrs. Butler, as having been occasionally evidenced by
      herself, the true art, we should have said, subsists in the indication and
      the repression, far rather than in the actual exhibition or manifestation
      of the emotions that are to be represented. Better by far than the
      familiar <i>si vis me flere</i> axiom of Horace, who there tells us, &ldquo;If
      you would have me weep, you must first weep yourself,&rdquo; is the sagacious
      comment on it in the <i>Tatler</i>, where (No. 68) the essayist remarks,
      with subtle discrimination: &ldquo;The true art seems to be when you would have
      the person you represent pitied, you must show him at once, in the highest
      grief, and struggling to bear it with decency and patience. In this case,&rdquo;
       adds the writer, &ldquo;we sigh for him, and give him every groan he
      suppresses.&rdquo; As for the extravagant idea of any artist, however great,
      identifying himself for the time being with the part he is enacting, who
      is there that can wonder at the snort of indignation with which Doctor
      Johnson, talking one day about acting, asked Mr. Kemble, &ldquo;Are you, sir,
      one of those enthusiasts who believe yourself transformed into the very
      character you represent?&rdquo; Kemble answering, according to Boswell, that he
      had never himself felt so strong a persuasion&mdash;&ldquo;To be sure not, sir,&rdquo;
       says Johnson, &ldquo;the thing is impossible.&rdquo; Adding, with one of his dryly
      comical extravagances: &ldquo;And if Garrick really believed himself to be that
      monster Richard the Third, he deserved to be hanged every time he
      performed it.&rdquo; What Dickens himself really thought of these wilder
      affectations of intensity among impersonators, is, with delicious humour,
      plainly enough indicated through that preposterous reminiscence of Mr.
      Crummies, &ldquo;We had a first-tragedy man in our company once, who, when he
      played Othello, used to black himself all over! But that's feeling a part,
      and going into it as if you meant it; it isn't usual&mdash;more's the
      pity.&rdquo; Thoroughly giving himself up to the representation of whatever
      character he was endeavouring at the moment to portray, or rather to
      impersonate, Charles Dickens so completely held his judgment the while in
      equipoise, as master of his twofold craft&mdash;that is, both as creator
      and as elocutionist, as author and as reader&mdash;that, as an invariable
      rule, he betrayed neither of those signs of insincerity, by the
      inadvertent revelation of which all sense of illusion is utterly and
      instantly dissipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever scenes he described, those scenes his hearers appeared to be
      actually witnessing themselves. He realised everything in his own mind so
      intensely, that listening to him we realised what he spoke of by sympathy.
      Insomuch that one might, in his own words, say of him, as David
      Copperfield says of Mr. Peggotty, when the latter has been recounting
      little Emily's wanderings: &ldquo;He saw everything he related. It passed before
      him, as he spoke, so vividly, that, in the intensity of his earnestness,
      he presented what he described to me with greater distinctness than I can
      express. I can hardly believe&mdash;writing now long afterwards&mdash;but
      that I was actually present in those scenes; they are impressed upon me
      with such an astonishing air of fidelity.&rdquo; While, on the one hand, he
      never repeated the words that had to be delivered phlegmatically, or as by
      rote; on the other hand, he never permitted voice, look, gesture, to pass
      the limits of discretion, even at moments the most impassioned; as, for
      example, where Nancy, in the famous murder-scene, shrieked forth her last
      gasping and despairing appeals to her brutal paramour. The same thing may
      be remarked again in regard to all the more tenderly pathetic of his
      delineations. His tones then were often subdued almost to a whisper, every
      syllable, nevertheless, being so distinctly articulated as to be audible
      in the remotest part of a vast hall like that in Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever may be insinuated in regard to those particular portions of the
      writings of our great novelist by cynical depreciators, who have not the
      heart to recognise&mdash;as did Lord Jeffrey, for instance, one of the
      keenest and shrewdest critics of his age&mdash;the exquisite pathos of a
      death-scene like that of little Nell or of little Paul Dombey, in the
      utterance by himself of those familiar passages nothing but the manliest
      emotion was visible and audible from first to last. Insomuch was this the
      case, that the least impressionable of his hearers might readily have
      echoed those noble words, written years ago, out of an overflowing heart,
      in regard to Charles Dickens, by his great rival and his intense admirer,
      W. M. Thackeray: &ldquo;In those admirable touches of tender humour, who ever
      equalled this great genius? There are little words and phrases in his
      books which are like personal benefits to the reader. What a place to hold
      in the affections of men! What an awful responsibility hanging over a
      writer!&rdquo; And so on, Thackeray saying all this! Thackeray speaking thus in
      ejaculatory sentences indicative of his gratitude and of his admiration!
      Passages that to men like William Thackeray and Francis Jeffrey were
      expressive only of inimitable tenderness, might be read dry-eyed by less
      keen appreciators, from the printed page, might even be ludicrously
      depreciated by them as mere mawkish sentimentality. But, even among these,
      there was hardly one who could hear those very passages read by Dickens
      himself without recognising at last, what had hitherto remained
      unperceived and unsuspected, the gracious and pathetic beauty animating
      every thought and every word in the original descriptions. Equally, it may
      be said, in the delineation of terror and of pathos, in the murder-scene
      from Oliver Twist, and in the death-scene of little Dombey, the
      novelist-reader attained success by the simple fact of his never once
      exaggerating.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been well remarked by an eminent authority upon the art of
      elocution, whose opinions have been already quoted in these pages, to wit,
      John Ireland, that &ldquo;There is a point to which the passions must be raised
      to display that exhibition of them which scatters contagious tenderness
      through the whole theatre, but carried, though but the breadth of a hair,
      beyond that point, the picture becomes an overcharged caricature, as
      likely to create laughter as diffuse distress.&rdquo; Never, perhaps, has that
      subtle boundary-line been hit with more admirable dexterity, just within
      the hair's breadth here indicated, than it was, for example, in Macready's
      impersonation of Virginius, where his scream in the camp-scene betrayed
      his instantaneous appreciation of the wrong meditated by Appius Claudius
      against the virginal purity of his daughter. As adroitly, in his way, as
      that great master of his craft, who was for so many years among his most
      cherished friends and intimates, Dickens kept within the indicated lines
      of demarcation, beyond which no impersonator, whether upon the stage or
      upon the platform, can ever pass for a single instant with impunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of Munden, in one of the most charming of his Essays, Charles
      Lamb has said, &ldquo;I have seen him diffuse a glow of sentiment which has made
      the pulse of a crowded house beat like that of one man; when he has come
      in aid of the pulpit, doing good to the moral heart of a people.&rdquo; The
      words, applied thus emphatically to the humorous and often grotesque
      comedian, are exactly applicable to Dickens as a Reader. And, as Elia
      remarks of Munden at another moment, &ldquo;he is not one, but legion; not so
      much a comedian as a company&rdquo;&mdash;any one might say identically the same
      of Dickens, who bears in remembrance the wonderful variety of his
      impersonations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attending his Readings, character after character appeared before us,
      living and breathing, in the flesh, as we looked and listened. It mattered
      nothing, just simply nothing, that the great author was there all the
      while before his audience in his own identity. His evening costume was a
      matter of no consideration&mdash;the flower in his button-hole, the
      paper-knife in his hand, the book before him, that earnest, animated,
      mobile, delightful face, that we all knew by heart through his ubiquitous
      photographs&mdash;all were equally of no account whatever. We knew that he
      alone was there all the time before us, reading, or, to speak more
      accurately, re-creating for us, one and all&mdash;while his lips were
      articulating the familiar words his hand had written so many years
      previously&mdash;the most renowned of the imaginary creatures peopling his
      books. Watching him, hearkening to him, while he stood there unmistakably
      before his audience, on the raised platform, in the glare of the
      gas-burners shining down upon him from behind the pendant screen
      immediately above his head, his individuality, so to express it,
      altogether disappeared, and we saw before us instead, just as the case
      might happen to be, Mr. Pickwick, or Mrs. Gamp, or Dr. Marigold, or little
      Paul Dombey, or Mr. Squeers, or Sam Weller, or Mr. Peggotty, or some other
      of those immortal personages. We were as conscious, as though we saw them,
      of the bald head, the spectacles, and the little gaiters of Mr. Pickwick&mdash;of
      the snuffy tones, the immense umbrella, and the voluminous bonnet and gown
      of Mrs. Gamp&mdash;of the belcher necktie, the mother-of-pearl buttons and
      the coloured waistcoat of the voluble Cheap Jack&mdash;of little Paul's
      sweet face and gentle accents&mdash;of the one eye and the well-known pair
      of Wellingtons, adorning the head and legs of Mr. Wackford Squeers&mdash;of
      Sam's imperturbable nonchalance&mdash;and of Mr. Peggotty's hearty, briny,
      sou'-wester of a voice and general demeanour!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the lesser characters&mdash;those which are introduced into the
      original works quite incidentally, occupying there a wholly subordinate
      position, filling up a space in the crowded tableaux, always in the
      background&mdash;were then at last brought to the fore in the course of
      these Readings, and suddenly and for the first time assumed to themselves
      a distinct importance and individuality. Take, for instance, the nameless
      lodging-housekeeper's slavey, who assists at Bob Sawyer's party, and who
      is described in the original work as &ldquo;a dirty, slipshod girl, in black
      cotton stockings, who might have passed for the neglected daughter of a
      superannuated dustman in very reduced circumstances.&rdquo; No one had ever
      realised the crass stupidity of that remarkable young person&mdash;dense
      and impenetrable as a London fog&mdash;until her first introduction in
      these Readings, with &ldquo;Please, Mister Sawyer, Missis Raddle wants to speak
      to <i>you!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the dull, dead-level of her voice ending in the last
      monosyllable with a series of inflections almost amounting to a chromatic
      passage. Mr. Justice Stareleigh, again!&mdash;nobody had ever conceived
      the world of humorous suggestiveness underlying all the words put into his
      mouth until the author's utterance of them came to the readers of Pickwick
      with the surprise of a revelation. Jack Hopkins in like manner&mdash;nobody,
      one might say, had ever dreamt of as he was in Dickens's inimitably droll
      impersonation of him, until the lights and shades of the finished picture
      were first of all brought out by the Reading. Jack Hopkins!&mdash;with the
      short, sharp, quick articulation, rather stiff in the neck, with a dryly
      comic look just under the eyelids, with a scarcely expressible relish of
      his own for every detail of that wonderful story of his about the
      &ldquo;neckluss,&rdquo; an absolute and implicit reliance upon Mr. Pickwick's
      gullibility, and an inborn and ineradicable passion for chorusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with the characters, so with the descriptions. One was life itself, the
      other was not simply word-painting, but realisation. There was the Great
      Storm at Yarmouth, for example, at the close of David Copperfield.
      Listening to that Reading, the very portents of the coming tempest came
      before us!&mdash;the flying clouds in wild and murky confusion, the moon
      apparently plunging headlong among them, &ldquo;as if, in a dread disturbance of
      the laws of nature, she had lost her way and were frightened,&rdquo; the wind
      rising &ldquo;with an extraordinary great sound,&rdquo; the sweeping gusts of rain
      coming before it &ldquo;like showers of steel,&rdquo; and at last, down upon the shore
      and by the surf among the turmoil of the blinding wind, the flying stones
      and sand, &ldquo;the tremendous sea itself,&rdquo; that came rolling in with an awful
      noise absolutely confounding to the beholder! In all fiction there is no
      grander description than that of one of the sublimest spectacles in
      nature. The merest fragments of it conjured up the entire scene&mdash;aided
      as those fragments were by the look, the tones, the whole manner of the
      Reader. The listener was there with him in imagination upon the beach,
      beside David. He was there, lashed and saturated with the salt spray, the
      briny taste of it on his lips, the roar and tumult in his ears&mdash;the
      height to which the breakers rose, and, looking over one another bore one
      another down and rolled in, in interminable hosts, becoming at last, as it
      is written in that wonderful chapter (55) of David Copperfield, &ldquo;most
      appalling!&rdquo; There, in truth, the success achieved was more than an
      elocutionary triumph&mdash;it was the realisation to his hearers, by one
      who had the soul of a poet, and the gifts of an orator, and the genius of
      a great and vividly imaginative author, of a convulsion of nature when
      nature bears an aspect the grandest and the most astounding. However much
      a masterly description, like that of the Great Storm at Yarmouth, may be
      admired henceforth by those who never had the opportunity of attending
      these Readings, one might surely say to them, as Æschines said to the
      Rhodians, when they were applauding the speech of his victorious rival:
      &ldquo;How much greater would have been your admiration if only you could have
      heard him deliver it!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE READINGS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      How it happened that Charles Dickens came to give any readings at all from
      his own writings has already, in the preceding pages, been explained. What
      is here intended to be done is to put on record, as simply and as
      accurately as possible, the facts relating to the labours gone through by
      the Novelist in his professional character as a Public Reader. It will be
      then seen, immediately those facts have come to be examined in their
      chronological order, that they were sufficiently remarkable in many
      respects, as an episode in the life of a great author, to justify their
      being chronicled in some way or other, if only as constituting in their
      aggregate a wholly unexampled incident in the history of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      No writer, it may be confidently asserted, has ever enjoyed a wider
      popularity during his own life-time than Charles Dickens; or rather it
      might be said more accurately, no writer has ever enjoyed <i>so</i> wide a
      popularity among his own immediate contemporaries. And it was a popularity
      in many ways exceptional.
    </p>
    <p>
      It knew no fluctuation. It lasted without fading or faltering during
      thirty-four years altogether, that is to say, throughout the whole of
      Dickens's career as a novelist. It began with his very first book, when,
      as Thackeray put it, &ldquo;the young man came and took his place calmly at the
      head of the whole tribe, as the master of all the English humorists of his
      generation.&rdquo; It showed no sign whatever of abatement, when, in the middle
      of writing his last book, the pen fell from his hand on that bright
      summer's day, and through his death a pang of grief was brought home to
      millions of English-speaking people in both hemispheres. For his
      popularity had, among other distinctive characteristics, certainly this,&mdash;it
      was so peculiarly personal a popularity, his name being endeared to the
      vast majority who read his books with nothing less than affectionate
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides all this, it was his privilege throughout the whole of his
      literary career to address not one class, or two or three classes, but all
      classes of the reading public indiscriminately&mdash;the most highly
      educated and the least educated, young and old, rich and poor. His
      writings obtained the widest circulation, of course, among those who were
      the most numerous, such as among the middle classes and the better portion
      of the artisan population, but they found at the same time the keenest and
      cordialest appreciation among those who were necessarily the best
      qualified to pronounce an opinion upon their merits, among critics as
      gifted as Jeffrey and Sydney Smith, and among rivals as-illustrious as
      Lytton and Thackeray. It seems appropriate, therefore, that we should be
      enabled to add now, in regard to the possession of this exceptional
      reputation, and of a popularity in itself so instant, sustained, personal,
      and comprehensive, that, thanks entirely to these Readings, he was brought
      into more intimate relations individually with a considerable portion at
      least of the vast circle of his own readers, than have ever been
      established between any other author who could be named and <i>his</i>
      readers, since literature became a profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strictly speaking, the very first Reading given by Charles Dickens
      anywhere, even privately, was that which took place in the midst of a
      little home-group, assembled one evening in 1843, for the purpose of
      hearing the &ldquo;Christmas Carol,&rdquo; prior to its publication, read by him in
      the Lincoln's-Inn Square Chambers of the intimate friend to whom, eighteen
      years afterwards, was inscribed, as &ldquo;of right,&rdquo; the Library Edition of all
      the Novelist's works collectively. Thus unwittingly, and as it seems to us
      not unbefittingly, was rehearsed on the hearth of Dickens's future
      biographer, the first of the long series of Readings, afterwards to be
      given very publicly indeed, and to vast multitudes of people on both sides
      of the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As nearly as possible ten years after this, the public Readings commenced,
      and during the five next years were continued, though they were so but
      very intermittingly. Throughout that interval they were invariably given
      for the benefit of others, the proceeds of each Reading being applied to
      some generous purpose, the nature of which was previously announced. It
      was in the Town Hall at Birmingham, that immediately before the Christmas
      of 1853, the first of all these public Readings took place in the presence
      of an audience numbering fully two thousand. About a year before that, the
      Novelist had pledged himself to give this reading, or rather a series of
      three readings, for the purpose of increasing the funds of a new Literary
      and Scientific Institution then projected in Birmingham. On Thursday, the
      6th of January, 1853, a silver-gilt salver and a diamond ring, accompanied
      by an address, expressive of the admiration of the subscribers to the
      testimonial, had been publicly presented in that town to the popular
      author, at the rooms of the Society of Arts in Temple Row. The kind of
      feeling inspiring this little incident may be recognised through the
      inscription on the salver, which intimated that it, &ldquo;together with a
      diamond ring, was presented to Charles Dickens, Esq., by a number of his
      admirers in Birmingham, on the occasion of the literary and artistic
      banquet in that town, on the 6th of January, 1853, as a sincere testimony
      of their appreciation of his varied literary acquirements, and of the
      genial philosophy and high moral teaching which characterise his
      writings.&rdquo; It was upon the morrow of the banquet referred to in this
      inscription, a banquet which took place at Dee's Hotel immediately after
      the presentation of the testimonial to the Novelist, that the latter
      generously proposed to give later on some public Readings from his own
      books, in furtherance of the newly meditated Birmingham and Midland
      Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposition, in fact, was thrown out, gracefully and almost
      apologetically, in a letter, addressed by him to Mr. Arthur Ryland on the
      following day, the 7th of January. In this singularly interesting
      communication, which was read by its recipient on the ensuing Monday, at a
      meeting convened in the theatre of the Philosophical Institution, not only
      did Charles Dickens offer to read his &ldquo;Christmas Carol&rdquo; some time during
      the course of the next Christmas, in the Town Hall at Birmingham, but
      referring to the complete novelty of his proposal, he thus plainly
      intimated that the occasion would constitute his very first appearance
      upon any public platform as a Reader, while explaining, at the same time,
      the precise nature of the suggested entertainment. &ldquo;It would,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;take about two hours, with a pause of ten minutes half-way through. There
      would be some novelty in the thing, as I have never done it in public,
      though I have in private, and (if I may say so) with a great effect on the
      hearers.&rdquo; He further remarked, &ldquo;I was so inexpressibly gratified last
      night by the warmth and enthusiasm of my Birmingham friends, that I feel
      half ashamed this morning of so poor an offer: but as I decided on making
      it to you before I came down yesterday, I propose it nevertheless.&rdquo; As a
      matter of course the proposition was gratefully accepted, the Novelist
      formally undertaking to give the proffered Readings in the ensuing
      Christmas. This promise, before the year was out, Dickens returned from
      abroad expressly to fulfil&mdash;hastening homeward to that end, after a
      brief autumnal excursion in Italy and Switzerland with two of his friends,
      the late Augustus Egg, R. A., and Wilkie Collins, the novelist. On the
      arrival of the three in Paris, they were there joined by Charles Dickens's
      eldest son, who, having passed through his course at Eton, had just then
      been completing his scholastic education at Leipsic. The party thus
      increased to a <i>partie carrée</i>, hastened homewards more hurriedly
      than would otherwise have been necessary, so as to enable the author
      punctually to fulfil his long-standing engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on Tuesday, the 27th of December, 1853, therefore, that the very
      first of these famous Readings came off in the Town Hall at Birmingham.
      The weather was wretched, but the hall was crowded, and the audience
      enthusiastic. The Reading, which was the &ldquo;Christmas Carol,&rdquo; extended over
      more than three hours altogether, showing how very little of the original
      story the then unpractised hand of the Reader had as yet eliminated.
      Notwithstanding the length of the entertainment, the unflagging interest,
      more even than the hearty and reiterated applause of those who were
      assembled, showed the lively sense the author's first audience had of his
      newly-revealed powers as a narrator and impersonator. On the next day but
      one, Thursday, the 29th of December, he read there, to an equally large
      concourse, the &ldquo;Cricket on the Hearth.&rdquo; Upon the following evening,
      Friday, the 30th of December, he repeated the &ldquo;Carol&rdquo; to another densely
      packed throng of listeners, mainly composed, this time, according to his
      own express stipulation, of workpeople. So delighted were these
      unsophisticated hearers with their entertainer&mdash;himself so long
      familiarly known to them, but then for the first time seen and heard&mdash;that,
      at the end of the Reading, they greeted him with repeated rounds of
      cheering.

      Those three Readings at Birmingham added considerably to the funds of the
      Institute, enhancing them at least to the extent of £400 sterling. In
      recognition of the good service thus effectively and delightfully rendered
      to a local institution, to the presidency of which Charles Dickens himself
      was unanimously elected, an exquisitely designed silver flower-basket was
      afterwards presented to the novelist's wife. This graceful souvenir had
      engraved upon it the following inscription: &ldquo;Presented to Mrs. Charles
      Dickens by the Committee of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, as a
      slight acknowledgment of the debt of gratitude due to her husband, for his
      generous liberality in reading the 'Christmas Carol,' and the 'Cricket on
      the Hearth,' to nearly six thousand persons, in the Town Hall, Birmingham,
      on the nights-of December 27, 29, and 30, 1853, in aid of the funds for
      the establishment of the Institute.&rdquo; The incident of these three highly
      successful Readings entailed upon the Reader, as events proved, an
      enormous amount of toil, none of which, however, did he ever grudge, in
      affording the like good service to others, at uncertain intervals, in all
      parts, sometimes the remotest parts, of the United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be beside our present purpose to catalogue, one after another,
      the various Readings given in this-way by the Novelist, before he was
      driven to the necessity at last of either giving up reading altogether, or
      coming to the determination to adopt it, as he then himself expressed it,
      as one of his recognised occupations; that is, by becoming a Reader
      professionally.. It is with his career in his professional capacity as a
      Reader that we have here to do. Until he had formally and avowedly assumed
      that position, his labours in this way were, as a matter of course, in no
      respect whatever systematised. They were uncertain, and in one sense, as
      the sequel shewed, purely tentative or preliminary. They yielded a world
      of delight, however, and did a world of good at the same time; while they
      were, unconsciously to himself, preparing the way effectually&mdash;that
      is, by ripening his powers and perfecting his skill through practice&mdash;for
      the opening up to himself, quite legitimately, of a new phase in his
      career as a man of letters. Previously, again and again, with the pen in
      his hand, he had proved himself to be the master-humorist of his time. He
      was now vividly to attest that fact by word of mouth, by the glance of his
      eye, by the application to the reading of his own books, of his
      exceptional mimetic and histrionic gifts as an elocutionist. Added to all
      this, by merely observing how readily he could pour through the proceeds
      of these purely benevolent Readings, princely largess into the coffers of
      charities or of institutions in which he happened to be interested, he was
      to realise, what must otherwise have remained for him wholly unsuspected,
      that he had, so to speak, but to stretch forth his hand to grasp a
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the lapse of five years all this was at first very gradually, but
      at last quite irresistibly, brought home to his conviction. A few of the
      Readings thus given by him, out of motives of kindliness or generosity,
      may here, in passing, be particularised.
    </p>
    <p>
      A considerable time after the three Readings just mentioned, and which
      were distinctly inaugurative of the whole of our author's reading career,
      there was one, which came off in Peterborough, that has not only been
      erroneously described as antecedent to those three Readings at Birmingham,
      but has been depicted, at the same time, with details in the account of it
      of the most preposterous character. The Reader, for example, has been
      portrayed,&mdash;in this purely apocryphal description of what throughout
      it is always referred to as though it were the first Reading of all, which
      it certainly was not,&mdash;as in a highly nervous state from the
      commencement of it to its conclusion! This bemg said of one who, when
      asked if he ever felt nervous while speaking in public, is known to have
      replied, &ldquo;Not in the least &ldquo;&mdash;adding, that &ldquo;when first he took the
      chair he felt as much confidence as though he had already done the like a
      hundred times!&rdquo; As corroborative of which remark, the present writer
      recalls to recollection very clearly the fact of Dickens saying to him one
      day,&mdash;saying it with a most whimsical air by-the-bye, but very
      earnestly,&mdash;&ldquo;Once, and but once only in my life, I was&mdash;frightened!&rdquo;
       The occasion he referred to was simply this, as he immediately went on to
      explain, that somewhere about the middle of the serial publication of
      David Copperfield, happening to be out of writing-paper, he sallied forth
      one morning to get a fresh supply at the stationer's. He was living then
      in his favourite haunt, at Fort House, in Broadstairs. As he was about to
      enter the stationer's shop, with the intention of buying the needful
      writing-paper, for the purpose of returning home with it, and at once
      setting to work upon his next number, not one word of which was yet
      written, he stood aside for a moment at the threshold to allow a lady to
      pass in before him. He then went on to relate&mdash;with a vivid sense
      still upon him of mingled enjoyment and dismay in the mere recollection&mdash;how
      the next instant he had overheard this strange lady asking the person
      behind the counter for the new green number. When it was handed to her,
      &ldquo;Oh, this,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have read. I want the next one.&rdquo; The next one she
      was thereupon told would be out by the end of the month. &ldquo;Listening to
      this, unrecognised,&rdquo; he added, in conclusion, &ldquo;knowing the purpose for
      which I was there, and remembering that not one word of the number she was
      asking for was yet written, for the first and only time in my life, I felt&mdash;frightened!&rdquo;
       So much for the circumstantial account put forth of this Reading at
      Peterborough, and of the purely imaginary nervousness displayed by the
      Reader, who, on the contrary, there, as elsewhere, was throughout
      perfectly self-possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday, the 22nd December, 1855, in the Mechanics' Hall at Sheffield,
      another of these Readings was given, it being the &ldquo;Carol,&rdquo; as usual, and
      the proceeds being in aid of the funds of that institution. The Mayor of
      Sheffield, who presided upon the occasion, at the close of the
      proceedings, presented to the author, as a suitable testimonial from a
      number of his admirers in that locality, a complete set of table cutlery.
    </p>
    <p>
      An occasional Reading, moreover, was given at Chatham, to assist in
      defraying the expenses of the Chatham, Rochester, Strood, and Brompton
      Mechanics' Institution, of which the master of Gadshill was for thirteen
      years the President. His titular or official connection with this
      institute, in effect, was that of Perpetual President. His interest in it
      in that character ceased only with his life. Throughout the whole of the
      thirteen years during which he presided over its fortunes, he was in every
      imaginable way its most effective and energetic supporter. Six Readings in
      all were given by him at the Chatham Mechanics' Institution, in aid of its
      funds. The first, which was the &ldquo;Christmas Carol,&rdquo; took place on the 27th
      December, 1857, the new Lecture Hall, which was appropriately decorated
      with evergreens and brilliantly illuminated, being crowded with auditors,
      conspicuous among whom were the officers of the neighbouring garrison and
      dockyard. The second, which consisted of &ldquo;Little Dombey&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Trial
      Scene from Pickwick,&rdquo; came off on the 29th December, 1858. Long before any
      arrangement had been definitively made in regard to this second Reading,
      the local newspaper, in an apparently authoritative paragraph, announced,
      &ldquo;on the best authority,&rdquo; that another Reading-was immediately to be given,
      by Mr. Dickens, in behalf of the Mechanics' Institution. It is
      characteristic of him that he, thereupon, wrote to the Chatham newspaper,
      &ldquo;I know nothing of your 'best authority,' except that he is (as he always
      is) preposterously and monstrously wrong.&rdquo; Eventually this Reading was
      arranged for, nevertheless, and came off at the date already mentioned. A
      third Reading at Chatham, comprising within it &ldquo;The Poor Traveller&rdquo; (the
      opening of which had a peculiar local interest), &rdquo;Boots&rdquo; at the &ldquo;Holly Tree
      Inn,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mrs. Gamp,&rdquo; took place in 1860, on the 18th December. A fourth
      was given there on the 16th January, 1862, when the Novelist read his six
      selected chapters from &ldquo;David Copperfield.&rdquo; A fifth, consisting of
      &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby at Dotheboys Hall,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Bob Sawyer's-Party,&rdquo; took
      place in 1863, on the 15th December. Finally, there came off the sixth of
      these Chatham readings, on the 19th December, 1865, when the &ldquo;Carol&rdquo; was
      repeated, with the addition of the great case of &ldquo;Bardell versus
      Pickwick.&rdquo; Upwards of £400 were thus, as the fruit of these exhilarating
      entertainments, poured into the coffers of the Chatham Institute. It can
      hardly be wondered at that, in the annual reports issued by the committee,
      emphatic expression should have been more than once given to the deep
      sense of gratitude entertained by them for the services rendered to the
      institution by its illustrious president-A fragmentary portion of that
      issued by the committee in the January of 1864&mdash;referring, as it
      does, to-Charles Dickens, in association with his home and his favourite
      haunts down at Gadshill&mdash;we are here tempted to give, as indicative
      of the feelings of pride and admiration with which the great author was
      regarded by his own immediate neighbours. After referring to the large
      sums realised for the institution through the Readings thus generously
      given by its president, the committee went on to say in this report, at
      the beginning of 1864, &ldquo;Simply to have the name of one whose writings have
      become household words at every home and hearth where the English language
      is spoken, associated with their efforts for the public entertainment and
      improvement, must be considered a great honour and advantage. But, when to
      this is added the large pecuniary assistance derived from such a
      connection, your committee find that they&mdash;and, of course, the
      members whom they represent&mdash;owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Dickens,
      which words can but poorly express. They trust that the home which he now
      occupies in the midst of the beautiful woodlands of Kent, and so near to
      the scene of his boyish memories and associations, may long be to him one
      of happiness and prosperity. If Shakspere, our greatest national poet, had
      before made Gadshill a classic spot, surely it is now doubly consecrated
      by genius since Dickens, the greatest and most genial of modern humorists,
      as well as one of the most powerful and pathetic delineators of human
      character, has fixed his residence there. To those who have so often and
      so lately been moved to laughter and tears by the humour and pathos of the
      inimitable writer and reader, and who have profited by his gratuitous
      services to the institution, your committee feel that they need make no
      apology for dwelling at some length upon this most agreeable part of their
      report.&rdquo; Thus profound were the feelings of respect, affection, and
      admiration with which the master-humorist was regarded by those who lived,
      and who were proud of living, in his own immediate neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of Tuesday, the 30th June, 1857, Charles Dickens read for
      the first time in London, at the then St. Martin's Hall, now the Queen's
      Theatre, in Long Acre. The occasion was one, in many respects, of peculiar
      interest. As recently as on the 8th of that month, Douglas Jerrold had
      breathed his last, quite unexpectedly. Dying in the fulness of his powers,
      and at little more than fifty years of age, he had passed away, it was
      felt, prematurely. As a tribute of affection to his memory, and of
      sympathy towards his widow and orphan children, those among his brother
      authors who had been more intimately associated with him in his literary
      career, organised, in the interests of his bereaved family, a series of
      entertainments. And in the ordering of the programme it was so arranged
      that this earliest metropolitan reading of one of his smaller works by
      Charles Dickens should be the second of these entertainments. Densely
      crowded in every part, St. Martin's Hall upon this occasion was the scene
      of as remarkable a reception and of as brilliant a success as was in any
      way possible. It was a wonderful success financially. As an elocutionary&mdash;or,
      rather, as a dramatic&mdash;display, it was looked forward to with the
      liveliest curiosity. The author's welcome when he appeared upon the
      platform was of itself a striking attestation of his popularity.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Upwards of fourteen years have elapsed since the occasion referred to,
yet we have still as vividly in our remembrance, as though it were but
an incident of yesterday, the enthusiasm of the reception then accorded
to the great novelist by an audience composed, for the most part,
of representative Londoners. The applause with which he was greeted,
immediately upon his entrance, was so earnestly prolonged and sustained,
that it threatened to postpone the Reading indefinitely. Silence having
at last been restored, however, the Reader's voice became audible in the
utterance of these few and simple words, by way of preliminary:&mdash;

     &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour to read
     &ldquo;to you 'A Christmas Carol,' in four staves. Stave
     &ldquo;one, 'Marley's Ghost.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The effect, by the way, becoming upon the instant rather incongruous, as
      the writer of this very well remembers, when, through a sudden and jarring
      recollection of what the occasion was that had brought us all together,
      the Reader began, with a serio-comic inflection, &ldquo;Marley was dead: to
      begin with. There's no doubt whatever about that. The register of his
      burial was signed.&rdquo; And so on through those familiar introductory
      sentences, in which Jacob Marley's demise is insisted upon with such
      ludicrous particularity. The momentary sense of incongruity here referred
      to was lost, however, directly afterwards, as everyone's attention became
      absorbed in the author's own relation to us of his world-famous
      ghost-story of Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the First Reading of the tale down in the provinces had occupied
      three hours in its delivery, the First Reading of it in the metropolis had
      been; diminished by half an hour. Beginning at 8 p.m., and ending at very
      nearly 10.30 p. m., with merely five minutes' interruption about midway,
      the entertainment so enthralled and delighted the audience throughout,
      that its close, after two hours and a half of the keenest attention, was
      the signal for a long outburst of cheers, mingled with the waving of hats
      and handkerchiefs. The description of the scene there witnessed is in
      noway exaggerated. It is the record of our own remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the enthusiasm thus awakened among Charles Dickens's first London
      audience can hardly be wondered at, when we recall to mind Thackeray's
      expression of opinion in regard to that very same story of the Christmas
      Carol immediately after its publication, when he wrote in <i>Fraser</i>,
      July, 1844, under his pseudonym of M. A. Titmarsh: &ldquo;It seems to me a
      national benefit, and to every man and woman who-reads it a personal
      kindness;&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;The last two people I heard speak of it were women;
      neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism,
      'God bless him!'&rdquo; Precisely in the same way, it may here be said, in
      regard to that first night of his own public reading of it in St. Martin's
      Hall, that there was a genial grasp of the hand in the look of every kind
      face then turned towards the platform, and a &ldquo;God bless him&rdquo; in every one
      of the ringing cheers that accompanied his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Reading of the &ldquo;Carol&rdquo; was given by its author in the following December
      down at Coventry, in aid of the funds of the local institute. And about a
      twelvemonth afterwards, on the 4th of December, 1858, in grateful
      acknowledgment of what was regarded in those cases always as a double
      benefaction (meaning the Reading itself and its golden proceeds), the
      novelist was entertained at a public banquet, at the Castle Hotel,
      Coventry, when a gold watch was presented to him as a testimonial of
      admiration from the leading inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, as the last of all these non-professional readings by our author,
      there was given on Friday the 26th of March, 1858, a reading of the
      &ldquo;Christmas Carol,&rdquo; in the Music Hall at Edinburgh. His audience consisted
      of the members of, or subscribers to, the Philosophical Institution. At
      the close of the evening the Lord Provost, who had been presiding,
      presented to the Reader a massive and ornate silver wassail bowl.
      Seventeen years prior to that, Charles Dickens had been publicly
      entertained in Edinburgh,&mdash;Professor Wilson having been the chairman
      of the banquet given then in his honour. He had been at that time enrolled
      a burgess and guildbrother of the ancient corporation of the metropolis of
      Scotland. He had, among other incidents of a striking character marking
      his reception there at the same period, seen, on his chance entrance into
      the theatre, the whole audience rise spontaneously in recognition of him,
      the musicians in the orchestra, with a courtly felicity, striking up the
      cavalier air of &ldquo;Charley is my Darling.&rdquo; If only out of a gracious
      remembrance of all this, it seemed not inappropriate that the very last of
      the complimentary readings should have been given by the novelist at
      Edinburgh, and that the Lord Provost of Edinburgh should, as if by way of
      stirrup-cup, have handed to the Writer and Reader of the &ldquo;Carol,&rdquo; that
      souvenir from its citizens, in honour of the author himself and of his
      favourite theme, Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in connection with the organisation of the series of
      entertainments, arranged during the summer of 1857, in memory of Jerrold,
      and in the interests of Jerrold's family, that the attention of Charles
      Dickens was first of all awakened to a recognition of the possibility that
      he might, with good reason, do something better than carry out his
      original intention, that, namely, of dropping these Readings altogether,
      as simply exhausting and unremunerative. He had long since come to realise
      that it could in no conceivable way whatever derogate from the dignity of
      his position as an author, to appear thus in various parts of the United
      Kingdom, before large masses of his fellow-countrymen, in the capacity of
      a Public Reader. His so appearing was a gratification to himself as an
      artist, and was clearly enough also a gratification to his hearers, as
      appreciators of his twofold art, both as Author and as Reader. He
      perceived clearly enough, therefore, that his labours in those associated
      capacities were perfectly compatible; that, in other words, he might, if
      he so pleased, quite reasonably accept the duties devolving upon him as a
      Reader, as among his legitimate avocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conspicuous among those who had shared in the getting up of the Jerrold
      entertainments&mdash;including among them, as we have seen, the first of
      his own Readings in London&mdash;the novelist had especially observed the
      remarkable skill or aptitude, as a general organiser, manifested from
      first to last by the Honorary Secretary, into whose hands, in point of
      fact, had fallen the responsibility of the entire management. This
      Honorary Secretary was no other than Albert Smith's brother Arthur&mdash;one
      who was not only the right-hand, as it were, of the Ascender of Mont
      Blanc, and of the Traveller in China, but who (behind the scenes, and
      unknown to the public) was the veritable wire-puller, prompter, Figaro,
      factotum of that <i>farceur</i>.among story-tellers, and of that
      laughter-moving patterer among public entertainers. Arthur Smith, full of
      resource, of contrivance, and of readiness, possessed in fact all the
      qualifications essential to a rapid organiser. He was, of all men who
      could possibly have been hit upon, precisely the very one to undertake in
      regard to an elaborate enterprise, like that of a long series of Readings
      in the metropolis, and of a comprehensive tour of Readings in the
      provinces, the responsible duties of its commercial management. Brought
      together accidentally at the time of the Jerrold testimonial, the Honorary
      Secretary of the fund and the Author-reader of the &ldquo;Carol&rdquo; came, as it
      seems now, quite naturally, to be afterwards intimately associated with
      one another, more in connection with the scheme of professional Readings,
      which reasonably grew up at last out of the previous five years' Readings,
      of a purely complimentary character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, as has been said on an earlier page, Charles Dickens cannot
      have given less than some Five Hundred Readings. As a professional Reader
      alone he gave considerably over Four Hundred. Beginning in the spring of
      1858, and ending in the spring of 1870, his career in that capacity
      extended at intervals over a lapse of twelve years: those twelve years
      embracing within them several distinct tours in England, Ireland, and
      Scotland, and in the United States; and many either entirely distinct or
      carefully interwoven series in London at St. Martin's Hall, at the Hanover
      Square Rooms, and at St. James's Hall, Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first series in the metropolis, and the first tour in the United
      Kingdom, were made in 1858, under Mr. Arthur Smith's management. The
      second provincial tour, partly in 1861, partly in 1862, and two sets of
      readings in London, one at the St. James's Hall in 1862, the other at the
      Hanover Square Rooms in 1863, took place under Mr. Thomas Headland's
      management. As many as four distinct, and all of them important tours,
      notably one on the other side of the Atlantic, were carried out between
      1866 and 1869, both years inclusive, under Mr. George Dolby's management.
      As showing at once the proportion of the enormous aggregate of 423
      Readings, with winch these three managers were concerned, it may be added
      here that while the first-mentioned had to do with 111, and the second
      with 70, the third and last-mentioned had to do with as many as 242
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the evening of Thursday, the 29th of April, 1858, that Charles
      Dickens first made his appearance upon a platform in a strictly
      professional character as a public Reader. Although, hitherto, he had
      never once read for himself, he did so then avowedly&mdash;not merely by
      printed announcement beforehand, but on addressing himself by word of
      mouth to the immense audience assembled there in St. Martin's Hall. The
      Reading selected for the occasion was &ldquo;The Cricket on the Hearth,&rdquo; but
      before its commencement, the author spoke as follows, doing so with well
      remembered clearness of articulation, as though he were particularly
      desirous that every word should be thoroughly weighed by his hearers, and
      taken to heart, by reason of their distinctly explaining the relations in
      which he and they would, thenceforth stand towards each other:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen,&mdash;It may, perhaps, be
     &ldquo;known to you that, for a few years past I have been
     &ldquo;accustomed occasionally to read some of my shorter
     &ldquo;books to various audiences, in aid of a variety of
     &ldquo;good objects, and at some charge to myself both in
     &ldquo;time and money. It having at length become im-
     &ldquo;possible in any reason to comply with these always
     &ldquo;accumulating demands, I have had definitely to
     &ldquo;choose between now and then reading on my own
     &ldquo;account as one of my recognised occupations, or not
     &ldquo;reading at all. I have had little or no difficulty in
     &ldquo;deciding on the former course.

     &ldquo;The reasons that have led me to it&mdash;besides the
     &ldquo;consideration that it necessitates no departure what-
     &ldquo;ever from the chosen pursuits of my life&mdash;are three-
     &ldquo;fold. Firstly, I have satisfied myself that it can
     &ldquo;involve no possible compromise of the credit and
     &ldquo;independence of literature. Secondly, I have long
     &ldquo;held the opinion, and have long acted on the opinion,
     &ldquo;that in these times whatever brings a public man
     &ldquo;and his public face to face, on terms of mutual con-
     &ldquo;fidence and respect, is a good thing. Thirdly, I
     &ldquo;have had a pretty large experience of the interest
     &ldquo;my hearers are so generous as to take in these occa-
     &ldquo;sions, and of the delight they give to me, as a tried
     &ldquo;means of strengthening those relations, I may
     &ldquo;almost say of personal friendship, which it is my
     &ldquo;great privilege and pride, as it is my great respon-
     &ldquo;sibility, to hold with a multitude of persons who will
     &ldquo;never hear my voice, or see my face.

     &ldquo;Thus it is that I come, quite naturally, to be here
     &ldquo;among you at this time. And thus it is that I pro-
     &ldquo;ceed to read this little book, quite as composedly as
     &ldquo;I might proceed to write it, or to publish it in any
     &ldquo;other way.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Remembering perfectly well, as we do, the precision with which he uttered
      every syllable of this little address, and the unmistakable cordiality
      with which its close was greeted, we can assert with confidence that
      Reader and Audience from the very first instant stood towards each other
      on terms of mutually respectful consideration. Remembering perfectly well,
      as we do, moreover, the emotion with which his last words were articulated
      and listened to on the occasion of his very last or Farewell Reading in
      the great hall near Piccadilly&mdash;and more than two thousand others
      must still perfectly well remember that likewise&mdash;we may no less
      confidently assert that those feelings had known no abatement, but on the
      contrary, had, during the lapse of many delightful years, come to be not
      only confirmed but intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixteen Readings were comprised in that first series in London, at St.
      Martin's Hall. Inaugurated, as we have seen, on the 29th of April, 1858,
      the series was completed on the 22nd of the ensuing July. It may here be
      interesting to mention that, midway in the course of these Sixteen
      Readings, he gave for the first time in London, on Thursday the 10th of
      June, &ldquo;The Story of Little Dombey,&rdquo; and on the following Thursday, the
      17th of June, also for the first time in London, &ldquo;The Poor Traveller,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Boots at the Holly Tree Inn,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mrs. Gamp.&rdquo; Whatever the subject of
      the Reading, whatever the state of the weather, the hall was crowded in
      every part, from the stalls to the galleries. Eleven days after the London
      season closed, the Reader and his business manager began their enormous
      round of the provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      As many as Eighty-Seven Readings were given in the course of this one
      provincial excursion. The first took place on Monday, the 2nd of August,
      at Clifton; the last on Saturday, the 13th of November, at Brighton. The
      places visited in Ireland included Dublin and Belfast, Cork and Limerick.
      Those traversed in Scotland comprised Edinburgh and Dundee, Aberdeen,
      Perth, and Glasgow. As for England, besides the towns already named,
      others of the first importance were taken in quick succession, an
      extraordinary amount of rapid railway travelling being involved in the
      punctual carrying out of the prescribed programme. However different in
      their general character the localities might be, the Readings somehow
      appeared to have some especial attraction for each, whether they were
      given in great manufacturing towns, like Manchester or Birmingham; in
      fashionable watering-places, like Leamington or Scarborough; in busy
      outports, like Liverpool or Southampton; in ancient cathedral towns, like
      York or Durham, or in seaports as removed from each other, as Plymouth and
      Portsmouth. Localities as widely separated as Exeter from Harrogate, as
      Oxford from Halifax, or as Worcester from Sunderland, were visited, turn
      by turn, at the particular time appointed. In a comprehensive round,
      embracing within it Wakefield and Shrewsbury, Nottingham and Leicester,
      Derby and Ruddersfield, the principal great towns were taken one after
      another. At Hull and Leeds, no less than at Chester and Bradford, as large
      and enthusiastic audiences were gathered together as, in their appointed
      times also were attracted to the Readings, in places as entirely
      dissimilar as Newcastle and Darlington, or as Sheffield and Wolverhampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enterprise was, in its way, wholly unexampled. It extended over a
      period of more than three months altogether. It brought the popular author
      for the first time face to face with a multitude of his readers in various
      parts of the three kingdoms. And at every place, without exception
      throughout the tour, the adventure was more than justified, as a source of
      artistic gratification alike to himself and to his hearers, no less than
      as a purely commercial undertaking, the project throughout proving
      successful far beyond the most sanguine anticipations. Though the strain
      upon his energies, there can be no doubt of it, was very considerable, the
      Reader had brought vividly before him in recompense, on Eighty-Seven
      distinct occasions, the most startling proofs of his popularity&mdash;the
      financial results, besides this, when all was over, yielding substantial
      evidence of his having, indeed, won &ldquo;golden opinions&rdquo; from all sorts of
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      His provincial tour, it has been seen, closed at Brighton on the 13th of
      November. Immediately after this, it was announced that three Christmas
      Readings would be given in London at St. Martin's Hall&mdash;the first and
      second on the Christmas Eve and the Boxing Day of 1858, those being
      respectively Friday and Monday, and the third on Twelfth Night, Thursday,
      the 6th of January, 1859. Upon each of these occasions the &ldquo;Christmas
      Carol&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Trial from Pickwick,&rdquo; were given to audiences that were
      literally overflowing, crowds of applicants each evening failing to obtain
      admittance. In consequence of this, three other Readings were announced
      for Thursday, the 13th, for Thursday, the 20th, and for Friday, the 28th
      of January&mdash;the &ldquo;Carol&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trial&rdquo; being fixed for the last time on
      the 13th; the Reading on the second of these three supplementary nights
      being &ldquo;Little Dombey&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Trial from Pickwick;&rdquo; the last of the three
      including within it, besides the &ldquo;Trial,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs. Gamp&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Poor
      Traveller.&rdquo; As affording conclusive proof of the sustained success of the
      Readings as a popular entertainment, it may here be added that
      advertisements appeared on the morrow of the one last mentioned, to the
      effect that &ldquo;it has been found unavoidable to appoint two more Readings of
      the 'Christmas Carol' and the 'Trial from Pickwick'&rdquo;&mdash;those two, by
      the way, being, from first to last, the most attractive of all the
      Readings. On Thursday, the 3rd, and on Tuesday, the 8th of February, the
      two last of these supplementary Readings in London, the aggregate of which
      had thus been extended from Three to Eight, were duly delivered. And in
      this way were completed the 111 Readings already referred to as having
      been given under Mr. Arthur Smith's management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upwards of two years and a half then elapsed without any more of the
      Readings being undertaken, either in the provinces or in the metropolis.
      During 1860, in fact, Great Expectations was appearing from week to week
      in <i>All the Year Round</i>. And it was a judicious rule with our author&mdash;broken
      only at the last, and fatally, at the very end of his twofold career as
      Writer and as Reader&mdash;never to give a series of Readings while one of
      his serial stories was being produced. At length, however, in the late
      summer, or early autumn of 1861, the novelist was sufficiently free from
      literary pre-occupations for another tour, and another series of Readings
      in London to be projected. The arrangements for each were sketched out by
      Mr. Arthur Smith, as the one still entrusted with the financial management
      of the undertaking. His health, however, was so broken by that time, that
      it soon became apparent that he could not reasonably hope to superintend
      in person the carrying out of the new enterprise. It was decided,
      therefore, provisionally, that Mr. Headland, who, upon the former
      occasion, had acted with him, should now, under his direction and as his
      representative, undertake the actual management. Before the projected tour
      of 1861 actually commenced, however, Mr. Arthur Smith had died, in
      September. The simply provisional arrangement lapsed in consequence, and
      upon Mr. Headland himself devolved the responsibility of carrying out the
      plans sketched out by his predecessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although about the same time that had been allotted to the First Tour,
      namely a whole quarter, had been set apart for the Second, the latter
      included within it but very little more than half the number of Readings
      given in the earlier and more rapid round of the provinces. The Second
      Tour, in point of fact&mdash;beginning on Monday, the 28th of October,
      1861, at Norwich, and terminating on Thursday, the 30th of January, 1862,
      at Chester&mdash;comprised within it Forty-Seven, instead of, as on the
      former occasion, Eighty-Seven readings altogether. Many of the principal
      towns and cities of England, not visited during the more comprehensive
      sweep made in 1858, through the three kingdoms, were now reached&mdash;the
      tour, this time, being restricted within the English boundaries. Lancaster
      and Carlisle, for example, Hastings and Canterbury, Ipswich and
      Colchester, were severally included in the new programme. Resorts of
      fashion, like Torquay and Cheltenham, were no longer overlooked. Preston
      in the north, Dover in the south, were each in turn the scene of a
      Reading. Bury St. Edmund's, in 1861, was reached on the 30th of October,
      and on the 25th of November an excursion was even made to the far-off
      border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed. Less hurried and less laborious than
      the first, this second tour was completed, as we have said, at Chester,
      just before the close of the first month of 1862, namely, on the 30th of
      January.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the turn once more of London, where a series of Ten Readings was
      given in the St. James's Hall, Piccadilly. These ten Readings, beginning
      on Thursday, the 13th of March, were distributed over sixteen weeks,
      ending on Friday, the 27th of June. Another metropolitan series, still
      under Mr. Headland's management, was given as nearly as possible at the
      same period of the London season in the following twelvemonth. The Hanover
      Square Booms were the scene of these Readings of 1863, which began on
      Monday, the 2nd of March, and ended on Saturday, the 13th of June,
      numbering in all not ten, as upon the last occasion, but Thirteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the winter of this year, Two notable Readings were given by the
      Novelist at the British Embassy, in Paris, their proceeds being devoted to
      the British Charitable Fund in that capital. These Readings were so
      brilliantly successful, that, by particular desire, they were, a little
      time afterwards, supplemented by a Third, which was quite as numerously
      attended as either of its predecessors. The audience upon each occasion,
      partly English, partly French, comprised among their number many of the
      most gifted and distinguished of the Parisians. These three entertainments
      were given under the immediate auspices of the Earl Cowley, then Her
      Majesty's ambassador to the court of Napoleon III.
    </p>
    <p>
      A considerable interval now elapsed, extending in fact over nearly three
      years altogether, before the author again appeared upon the platform in
      his capacity as a Reader, either in London or in the Provinces. During his
      last provincial tour, there had been some confusion caused to the general
      arrangements by reason of the abrupt but unavoidable postponement of a
      whole week's Readings, previously announced as coming off, three of them
      at Liverpool, one at Chester, and two at Manchester. These six readings
      instead, however, of duly taking place, as originally arranged, between
      the 16th and the 21st of December, 1861, had to be given four weeks later
      on, between the 13th and the 30th of the following January. The
      disarrangement of the programme thus caused arose simply from the
      circumstance of the wholly unlooked-for and lamented death of H. E. H. the
      Prince Consort. Another confusion in the carefully prepared plans for one
      of the London series, again, had been caused by an unexpected difficulty,
      at the last moment, in securing the great Hall in Piccadilly, that having
      been previously engaged on the required evenings for a series of musical
      entertainments. Hence the selection for that season of the Hanover Square
      Rooms, which, at any rate for the West-end public, could not but be
      preferable to that earliest scene of the London Readings, St. Martin's
      Hall, Long Acre. Apart from every other consideration, however, the
      Novelist's remembrance of the confusions and disarrangements which had
      been incidental to his last provincial tour, and to the last series of his
      London Readings, rather disinclined him to hasten the date of his
      re-appearance in his character as a public Reader. As it happened,
      besides, after the summer of 1863, nearly two years elapsed, between the
      May of 1864 and the November of 1865, during which he was in a manner
      precluded from seriously entertaining any such project by the circumstance
      that the green numbers of &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo; were, all that while, in
      course of publication. Even when that last of his longer serial stories
      had been completed, it is doubtful whether he would have cared to take
      upon himself anew the irksome stress and responsibility inseparable from
      one of those doubly laborious undertakings&mdash;a lengthened series of
      Readings in London, coupled with, or rather interwoven with, another
      extended tour through the provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it fortunately happened, however, very soon after the completion of
      &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend,&rdquo; Charles Dickens had held out to him a double
      inducement to undertake once more the duties devolving upon him in his
      capacity as a Reader. The toil inseparable from the Readings themselves,
      as well as the fatigue resulting inevitably from so much rapid travelling
      hither and thither by railway during the period set apart for their
      delivery, would still be his. But at the least, according to the
      proposition now made to him, the Reader would be relieved from further
      care as to the general supervision, and at any rate, from all sense of
      responsibility in the revived project as a purely financial or speculative
      undertaking. The Messrs. Chappell, of New Bond Street, a firm skilled in
      the organizing of public entertainments of various kinds, chiefly if not
      exclusively until then, entertainments of a musical character, offered, in
      fact, in 1866 to assume to themselves thenceforth the whole financial
      responsibility of the Readings in the Metropolis and throughout the United
      Kingdom. According to the proposal originally submitted to the Novelist by
      the Messrs. Chappell, and at once frankly accepted by him, a splendid sum
      was guaranteed to him in remuneration. Twice afterwards those terms were
      considerably increased,&mdash;and upon each occasion, it should be added,
      quite spontaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another inducement was held out to the Reader besides that of his being
      relieved from all further sense of responsibility in the undertaking as a
      merely speculative enterprise. It related to the chance of his finding
      himself released also from any further sense of solicitude as to the
      conduct of the general business management. The inducement, here, however,
      was of course in no way instantly recognizable. Experience alone could
      show the fitness for his post of the Messrs. Chappell's representative. As
      good fortune would have it, nevertheless, here precisely was an instance
      in which Mr. Layard's famous phrase about the right man in the right
      place, was directly applicable. As a thoroughly competent business
      manager, and as one whose companionship of itself had a heartening
      influence in the midst of enormous toil, Mr. Dolby speedily came to be
      recognised as the very man for the position, as the very one who in all
      essential respects it was most desirable should have been selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      A series of Thirty Readings was at once planned under his supervision. It
      consisted for the first time of a tour through England and Scotland,
      interspersed with Readings every now and then in the Metropolis. The
      Reader's course in this way seemed to be erratic, but the whole scheme was
      admirably well arranged beforehand, and once entered upon, was carried out
      with the precision of clockwork. These thirty Readings, in 1866, began and
      ended at St. James's Hall, Piccadilly. The opening night was that of
      Tuesday, the 10th of April, the closing night that of Tuesday, the 12th of
      June. Between those dates half-a-dozen other Readings were given from the
      same central platform in London, the indefatigable author making his
      appearance meanwhile alternately in the principal cities of the United
      Kingdom. Besides revisiting in this way (some of these places repeatedly)
      in the north, Edinburgh and Glasgow and Aberdeen, in the south and
      south-west, Clifton and Portsmouth, as well as Liverpool and Manchester
      intermediately&mdash;Charles Dickens during the course of this tour read
      for the first time at Bristol, at Greenwich, and in the Crystal Palace at
      Sydenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inauguration of the series of Readings now referred to had a peculiar
      interest imparted to it by the circumstance that, on the evening of
      Tuesday, the 10th of April, 1866, there was first of all introduced to
      public notice the comic patter and pathetic recollections of the Cheap
      Jack, Doctor Marigold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a year afterwards a longer series of the Readings began under the
      organisation of the Messrs. Chappell, and under the direction of Mr. Dolby
      as their business manager. It took place altogether under precisely
      similar circumstances as the last, with this only difference that the
      handsome terms of remuneration originally guaranteed to the author were,
      as already intimated, considerably and voluntarily increased by the
      projectors of the enterprise, the pecuniary results of the first series
      having been so very largely beyond their expectations. Fifty Readings
      instead of thirty were now arranged for&mdash;Ireland being visited as
      well as the principal towns and cities of England and Scotland. Six
      Readings were given at Dublin, and one at Belfast; four were given at
      Glasgow, and two at Edinburgh. Bath, for the first time, had the
      opportunity of according a public welcome to the great humorist, some of
      the drollest scenes in whose earliest masterpiece occur in the city of
      Bladud, as every true Pickwickian very well remembers. Then, also, for the
      first time, he was welcomed&mdash;by old admirers of his in his capacity
      as an author, new admirers of his thenceforth in his later and minor
      capacity as a Reader&mdash;at Swansea and Gloucester, at Stoke and
      Blackburn, at Hanley and Warrington. Tuesday, the 15th of January, 1867,
      was the inaugural night of the series, when &ldquo;Barbox, Brothers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
      Boy at Mugby,&rdquo; were read for the first time at St. James's Hall,
      Piccadilly. Monday, the 13th of May, was the date of the last night of the
      season, which was brought to a close upon the same platform, the success
      of every Reading, without exception, both in London and in the provinces,
      having been simply unexampled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was shortly after this that the notion was first entertained by the
      Novelist of entering upon that Reading Tour in America, which has since
      become so widely celebrated. Overtures had been made to him repeatedly
      from the opposite shores of the Atlantic, with a view to induce him to
      give a course of Readings in the United States. Speculators would gladly,
      no doubt, have availed themselves of so golden an opportunity for turning
      to account his immense reputation. There were those, however, at home
      here, who doubted as to the advisability of the author entering, under any
      conceivable circumstances, upon an undertaking obviously involving in its
      successful accomplishment an enormous amount of physical labour and
      excitement. Added to this, the project was inseparable in any case&mdash;however
      favourable might be the manner of its ultimate arrangement&mdash;from a
      profound sense of responsibility all through the period that would have to
      be set apart for its realisation. It was among the more remarkable
      characteristics of Charles Dickens that, while he was endowed with a
      brilliant imagination, and with a genius in many ways incomparable, he was
      at the same time gifted with the clearest and soundest judgment, being, in
      point of fact, what is called a thoroughly good man of business. Often as
      he had shewn this to be the case during the previous phases of his career,
      he never demonstrated the truth of it so undeniably as in the instance of
      this proposed Reading Tour in the United States. Determined to understand
      at once whether the scheme, commended by some, denounced by others, was in
      itself, to begin with, feasable, and after that advisable, he despatched
      Mr. Dolby to America for the purpose of surveying the proposed scene of
      operations. Immediately on his emissary's return, Dickens drew up a few
      pithy sentences, headed by him, &ldquo;The Case in a Nutshell.&rdquo; His decision was
      what those more immediately about him had for some time anticipated. He
      made up his mind to go, and to go quite independently. The Messrs.
      Chappell, it should be remarked at once, had no part whatever in the
      enterprise. The Author-Reader accepted for himself the sole responsibility
      of the undertaking. As a matter of course, he retained Mr. Dolby as his
      business manager, despatching him again across the Atlantic, when
      everything had been arranged between them, to the end that all should be
      in readiness by the time of his own arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the brief interval which then elapsed, Between the business
      manager's return to, and the Author-Reader's departure for, America, that
      well-remembered Farewell Banquet was given to Charles Dickens, which was
      not unworthy of signalising his popularity and his reputation. He himself,
      upon the occasion, spoke of it as that &ldquo;proud night,&rdquo; recognising clearly
      enough, as he could hardly fail to do, in the gathering around him, there
      in Freemasons' Hall, on the evening of the 2nd of November, 1867, one of
      the most striking incidents in a career that had been almost all sunshine,
      both from within and from without, from the date of its commencement. It
      was there, in the midst of what he himself referred to, at the time, as
      that &ldquo;brilliant representative company,&rdquo; while acknowledging the presence
      around him of so many of his brother artists, &ldquo;not only in literature, but
      also in the fine arts,&rdquo; he availed himself of the opportunity to relate
      very briefly the story of his setting out once more for America. &ldquo;Since I
      was there before,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a vast, entirely new generation has arisen in
      the United States. Since I was there before, most of the best known of my
      books have been written and published. The new generation and the books
      have come together and have kept together, until at last numbers of those
      who have so widely and constantly read me, naturally desiring a little
      variety in the relations between us, have expressed a strong wish that I
      should read myself. This wish at last conveyed to me, through public
      channels and business channels, has gradually become enforced by an
      immense accumulation of letters from individuals and associations of
      individuals, all expressing in the same hearty, homely, cordial,
      unaffected way a kind of personal interest in me; I had almost said a kind
      of personal affection for me, which I am sure you will agree with me, it
      would be dull insensibility on my part not to prize.&rdquo; Hence, as he
      explained, his setting forth on that day week upon his second visit to
      America, with a view among other purposes, according to his own happy
      phrase, to use his best endeavours &ldquo;to lay down a third cable of
      intercommunication and alliance between the old world and the new.&rdquo; The
      illustrious chairman who presided over that Farewell Banquet, Lord Lytton,
      had previously remarked, speaking in his capacity as a politician, &ldquo;I
      should say that no time could be more happily chosen for his visit;&rdquo;
       adding, &ldquo;because our American kinsfolk have conceived, rightly or
      wrongfully, that they have some cause of complaint against ourselves, and
      out of all England we could not have selected an envoy more calculated to
      allay irritation and to propitiate good will.&rdquo; As one whose cordial genius
      was, in truth, a bond of sympathy between the two great kindred
      nationalities, Charles Dickens indeed went forth in one sense at that
      time, it might almost have been said, in a semi-ambassadorial character,
      not between the rulers, but between the peoples. The incident of his visit
      to America could in no respect be considered a private event, but, from
      first to last, was regarded, and reasonably regarded, as a public and
      almost as an international occurrence. &ldquo;Happy is the man,&rdquo; said Lord
      Lytton, on that 2nd of November, when proposing the toast of the evening
      in words of eloquence worthy of himself and of his theme, &ldquo;Happy is the
      man who makes clear his title deeds to the royalty of genius, while he yet
      lives to enjoy the gratitude and reverence of those whom he has subjected
      to his sway. Though it is by conquest that he achieves his throne, he at
      least is a conqueror whom the conquered bless, and the more despotically
      he enthralls the dearer he becomes to the hearts of men.&rdquo; Observing, in
      conclusion, as to this portion of his argument, &ldquo;Seldom, I say, has that
      kind of royalty been quietly conceded to any man of genius until his tomb
      becomes his throne, and yet there is not one of us now present who thinks
      it strange that it is granted without a murmur to the guest whom we
      receive to-night.&rdquo; As if in practical recognition of the prerogative thus
      gracefully referred to by his brother-author, a royal saloon carriage on
      Friday, the 8th of November, conveyed Charles Dickens from London to
      Liverpool. On the following morning he took his departure on board the <i>Cuba</i>
      for the United States, arriving at Boston on Tuesday, the 19th, when the
      laconic message &ldquo;Safe and well,&rdquo; was flashed home by submarine telegraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Readings projected in America were intended to number up as many as
      eighty altogether. They actually numbered up exactly Seventy-Six. They
      were inaugurated by the first of the Boston Readings on Monday, the 2nd of
      December, 1867. Extending over an interval of less than five months, they
      closed in Steinway Hall on Monday, the 20th April, 1868, with the last of
      the New York Readings. From beginning to end, the enthusiasm awakened by
      these Readings was entirely unparalleled. Simply to ensure a chance of
      purchasing the tickets of admission, a queue of applicants a quarter of a
      mile long would pass a whole winter's night patiently waiting in sleet and
      snow, out in the streets, to be in readiness for the opening of the
      office-doors when the sale of tickets should have commenced. Blankets and
      in several instances mattresses were brought with them by some of the more
      provident of these nocturnal wayfarers, many of whom of course were
      notoriously middle-men who simply speculated, with immense profit to
      themselves, in selling again at enormously advanced prices the tickets
      which were invariably dispensed by the business manager at the fixed
      charges originally announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      As curiously illustrative of the first outburst of this enthusiasm even
      before the Novelist's arrival&mdash;on the very eve of that arrival, as it
      happened&mdash;mention may here be made of the simple facts in regard to
      the sale of tickets on Monday, the 18th of November. During the whole of
      that day, from the first thing in the morning to the last thing at night,
      Mr. Dolby sat there at his desk in the Messrs. Ticknor and Fields'
      bookstore, literally doing nothing but sell tickets as fast as he could
      distribute them and take the money. For thirteen hours together, without
      taking bite or sup, without ever once for a passing moment quitting the
      office-stool on which he was perched&mdash;fortunately for him behind a
      strong barricade&mdash;he answered the rush of applicants that steadily
      pressed one another onwards to the pigeon-hole, each drifting by exhausted
      when his claims were satisfied. The indefatigable manager took in moneys
      paid down within those thirteen consecutive hours as many as twelve
      thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the five months of his stay in America, four Readings a week were
      given by the Novelist to audiences as numerous as the largest building in
      each town of a suitable character could by any contrivance be made to
      contain. The average number of those present upon each of these occasions
      may be reasonably estimated as at the very least 1500 individuals.
      Remembering that there were altogether seventy-six Readings, this would
      show at once that upwards of one hundred thousand souls (114,000) listened
      to the voice of the great Author reading, what they had so often before
      read themselves, and raising their own voices in return to greet his ears
      with their ringing acclamations. At a moderate estimate, again, just as we
      have seen that each Reading represented 1500 as the average number of the
      audience, that audience represented, in its turn, in cash, at the lowest
      computation, nett proceeds amounting to fully $3000. At Rochester, for
      example, in the State of New York, was the smallest house anywhere met
      with in the whole course of these American Readings, and even that yielded
      $2500, the largest house in the tour, on the other hand, netting as much
      as $6000 and upwards. Multiplying, therefore, the reasonably-mentioned
      average of $3000 by seventy-six, as the aggregate number of the Readings,
      we arrive at the astounding result that in this tour of less than five
      months the Author-Reader netted altogether the enormous sum of $228,000.
      Supposing gold to have been then at par, that lump sum would have
      represented in our English currency what if spoken of even in a whisper
      would, according to Hood's famous witticism, have represented something
      like &ldquo;the roar of a Forty Thousand Pounder!&rdquo; Even as it was, then, gold
      being at 39 1/2 per cent, premium, with 1/4 per cent, more deducted on
      commission&mdash;virtually a drop of nearly 40 per cent, altogether!&mdash;the
      result was the winning of a fortune in what, but for the fatigue involved
      in it, might have been regarded as simply a holiday excursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fatigue here referred to, however, must have been something very
      considerable. Its influence was felt all the more, no doubt, by reason of
      the Novelist having had to contend during upwards of four hard winter
      months, as he himself laughingly remarked just before his return
      homewards, with &ldquo;what he had sometimes been quite admiringly assured, was
      a true American catarrh!&rdquo; Nevertheless, even with its depressing and
      exhausting influence upon him, he not only contrived to carry out the
      project upon which he had adventured, triumphantly to its appointed close,
      but even upon one of the most inclement days of an unusually inclement
      season, namely, on Saturday, the 29th of February, 1868, he actually took
      part as one of the umpires in the good-humoured frolic of a twelve-mile
      walking match, up hill and down dale, through the snow, on the Milldam
      road, between Boston and Newton, doing every inch of the way, heel and
      toe, as though he had been himself one of the competitors. The first six
      miles having been accomplished by the successful competitor in one hour
      and twenty-three minutes, and the return six in one hour and twenty-five
      minutes, the Novelist&mdash;although, with his light, springy step, he had
      observantly gone the whole distance himself, as we have seen, in his
      capacity as umpire,&mdash;presided blithely, in celebration of this winter
      day's frolic, at a sumptuous little banquet, given by him at the Parker
      House, a banquet that Lucullus would hardly have disdained. Having
      appeared before his last audience in America on the 20th of April, 1868,
      at New York, the Author-Reader addressed through them to all his other
      auditors in the United States, after that final Reading was over, a few
      genial and generous utterances of farewell. Among other things, he said to
      them,&mdash;&ldquo;The relations which have been set up between us, while they
      have involved for me something more than mere devotion to a task, have
      been sustained by you with the readiest sympathy and the kindest
      acknowledgment. Those relations must now be broken for ever. Be assured,
      however, that you will not pass from my mind. I shall often realise you as
      I see you now, equally by my winter fire, and in the green English summer
      weather. I shall never recall you as a mere audience, but rather as a host
      of personal friends,&mdash;and ever with the greatest gratitude,
      tenderness, and consideration.&rdquo; Two days before that last of all these
      American Readings, he had been entertained at a public banquet in New
      York, on the 18th of April, at Delmonico's. Two days after the final
      American Reading and address of farewell, he took his departure from New
      York on board the <i>Russia</i>, on Wednesday, the 22nd of April, arriving
      on Friday, the 1st of May, at Liverpool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely a month had elapsed after his return homewards, when the
      prospective and definitive close of the great author's career as a public
      Reader was formally announced. Again the Messrs. Chappell, of New Bond
      Street, appeared between the Novelist and the public as intermediaries.
      They intimated through their advertisement, that &ldquo;knowing it to be the
      determination of Mr. Dickens finally to retire from public Readings, soon
      after his return from America, they (as having been honoured with his
      confidence on former occasions) made proposals to him, while he was still
      in the United States achieving his recent brilliant successes there, for a
      final farewell series of Readings in this country.&rdquo; They added that &ldquo;their
      proposals were at once accepted in a manner highly gratifying to them;&rdquo;
       and that the series, which would commence in the ensuing autumn, would
      comprehend, besides London, several of the chief towns and cities of
      England, Ireland, and Scotland. Looking back to this preliminary
      advertisement now, there is a melancholy significance in the emphasis with
      which it was observed&mdash;&ldquo;It is scarcely necessary to add that any
      announcement made in connection with these Farewell Readings will be
      strictly adhered to and considered final; and that on no consideration
      whatever will Mr. Dickens be induced to appoint an extra night in any
      place in which he shall have been announced to read for the last time.&rdquo;
       According to promise, in the autumn, these well-remembered Farewell
      Readings commenced. They were intended to run on to the number of one
      hundred altogether. Beginning within the first week of October, they were
      not to end until the third week of the ensuing May. As it happened,
      Seventy-Four Readings were given in place of the full hundred. On Tuesday,
      the 6th of October, 1868, the series was commenced. On Thursday, the 22nd
      of April, 1869, its abrupt termination was announced, by a telegram from
      Preston, that caused a pang of grief and anxiety to the vast multitude of
      those to whom the very name of Charles Dickens had, for more than thirty
      years, been endeared. The intimation conveyed through that telegram was
      the fact of his sudden and alarming illness. Already, in the two preceding
      months, though the public generally had taken no notice of the
      circumstance, three of the Readings had, for various reasons, been
      unavoidably given up&mdash;one at Hull, fixed for the 12th of March, and
      previously one at Glasgow, fixed for the 18th, and another at Edinburgh,
      fixed for the 19th of February. Otherwise than in those three instances,
      the sequence of Readings marked on the elaborate programme had been most
      faithfully adhered to; the Reader, indeed, only succumbing at last under
      the nervous exhaustion caused by his own indomitable perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, now, matter of all but absolute certainty that his immense
      energies, his elastic temperament, and his splendid constitution had all
      of them, long before this, been cruelly overtaxed and overweighted.
      Unsuspected by any of us at the time, he had, there can be little doubt of
      it, received the deadliest shock to his whole system as far back as on the
      9th of June, 1865, in that terrible railway accident at Staplehurst, on
      the fifth anniversary of which fatal day, by a strange coincidence, he
      breathed his last. His intense vitality deceived himself and everybody
      else, however, until it was all too late. The extravagant toil he was
      going through for months together&mdash;whirling hither and thither in
      express trains, for the purpose of making one exciting public appearance
      after another, each of them a little world of animated impersonations&mdash;he
      accomplished with such unfailing and unflagging vivacity, with such an
      easy step, such an alert carriage, with such an animated voice and
      glittering eye, that for a long while at least we were under the illusion.
      Hurrying about England, Ireland, and Scotland as he was during almost the
      whole of the last quarter of 1868 and during the whole of the first
      quarter of 1869&mdash;dividing his time not only between Liverpool and
      Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow, Dublin and Belfast, with continual
      returns to his central reading-platform in the great Hall near Piccadilly,
      but visiting afterwards as well nearly all the great manufacturing towns
      and nearly all the fashionable watering-places&mdash;the wonder is now not
      so much that he gave in at last to the exorbitant strain, but that he did
      not give in much sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single incident will suffice to show the pace at which he was going
      before the overwrought system gave the first sign of its <i>being</i>
      overwrought. On the evening of Thursday, the 11th of March, 1869, an
      immense audience crowded the Festival Concert Room at York, the people
      there having only that one opportunity of attending a Farewell Reading. As
      they entered the room, each person received a printed slip of paper, on
      which was read, &ldquo;The audience are respectfully informed that carriages
      have been ordered tonight at half-past nine. Without altering his Reading
      in the least, Mr. Dickens will shorten his usual pauses between the Parts,
      in order that he may leave York by train a few minutes after that time. He
      has been summoned,&rdquo; it was added, &ldquo;to London, in connection with a late
      sad occurrence within the general knowledge, but a more particular
      reference to which would be out of place here.&rdquo; His attendance, in point
      of fact, was suddenly required at the funeral of a dear friend of his in
      the metropolis. To the funeral he had to go. From the poignantly irksome
      duty of the Reading he could not escape. Giving the latter even as
      proposed, he would barely have time to catch the up express, so as to
      arrive in town by the aid of rapid night travelling, and be true to the
      melancholy rendezvous at the scene of his friend's obsequies. The Readings
      that night were three, and they were given in rapid succession, the
      Reader, after the first and second, instead of withdrawing, as usual, for
      ten minutes' rest into his retiring room at the back of the platform,
      merely stepping for an instant or two behind the screen at the side of the
      platform, putting his lips to some iced champagne, and stepping back at
      once to the reading-desk. The selected Readings were these&mdash;&ldquo;Boots at
      the Holly-Tree Inn,&rdquo; the murder scene of &ldquo;Sikes and Nancy,&rdquo; and the
      grotesque monologue of &ldquo;Mrs. Gamp.&rdquo; The Archbishop and the other principal
      people of York were there conspicuously noticeable in the stalls, eagerly
      listening and keenly observant, evidently in rapt attention throughout the
      evening, but more especially during the powerfully acted tragic incident
      from &ldquo;Oliver Twist.&rdquo; The Reading, as a whole, was more than ordinarily
      successful&mdash;parts of it were exceptionally impressive. Directly it
      was over, the Reader, having had a <i>coupé</i> previously secured for his
      accommodation in the express, was just barely enabled, at a rush, to catch
      the train an instant or so before its starting. Then only, after it had
      started, could he give a thought to his dress, changing his clothes and
      snatching a morsel of supper in the railway carriage as he whirled on
      towards London. The occasion referred to serves, at any rate, to
      illustrate the wear and tear to which the Author had rendered himself,
      through these Readings, more or less continually liable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jeopardy in which it placed his life at last was alarmingly indicated
      by the peremptory order of his medical adviser, Mr. Frank Beard, of
      Welbeck Street&mdash;immediately on his arrival in Preston on the 22nd of
      April, in answer to a telegram summoning him thither upon the instant from
      London&mdash;that the Readings must be stopped then and thenceforth. When
      this happened, a fortnight had not elapsed after the grand Banquet given
      in honour of Charles Dickens at St. George's Hall, in Liverpool. As the
      guest of the evening, he had, there and then, been &ldquo;cheered to the echo&rdquo;
       by seven hundred enthusiastic admirers of his presided over by the Mayor
      of Liverpool. That was on Saturday, the 10th of April, during a
      fortnight's blissful rest in the whirling round of the Readings.
      Immediately that fortnight was over, the whirling round began again its
      momentarily interrupted gyrations. Three days in succession there was a
      Reading at Leeds&mdash;on Thursday, the 15th, Friday, the 16th, and
      Saturday, the 17th of April. On Monday, the 19th, there was a Reading at
      Blackburn; on Tuesday, the 20th, another at Bolton; on Wednesday, the
      21st, another at Southport. Then came the morning of the 22nd, on the
      evening of which Thursday he was to have read at Preston. By the then
      Dickens's medical adviser had arrived from London, the audience had
      already begun assembling. Thereupon, not only was that particular Reading
      prohibited, but, by the same wise mandate, all thought of resuming the
      course, or even a portion of it, afterwards, was as peremptorily
      interdicted. In one sense, it is only matter for wistful regret, now, that
      that judicious interdict was so far removed, three-quarters of a year
      afterwards, that the twelve Final Readings of Farewell which were given at
      the St. James' Hall in the spring of 1870, beginning on Tuesday, the 11th
      of January, and ending on Tuesday, the 15th of March, were' assented to as
      in any way reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      That even these involved an enormous strain upon the system, was proved to
      absolute demonstration by the statistics jotted down with the utmost
      precision during the Readings, as to the fluctuations of the Reader's
      pulse immediately before and immediately after each of his appearances
      upon the platform, mostly two, but often three, appearances in a single
      evening. The acceleration of his pulse has, to our knowledge, upon some of
      these occasions been something extraordinary. Upon the occasion of his
      last and grandest Reading of the Murder, for example, as he stepped upon
      the platform, resolved, apparently, upon outdoing himself, he remarked, in
      a half-whisper to the present writer, just before advancing from the cover
      of the screen to the familiar reading-desk, &ldquo;I shall tear myself to
      pieces.&rdquo; He certainly never acted with more impassioned earnestness&mdash;though
      never once, for a single instant, however, overstepping the boundaries of
      nature. His pulse just before had been tested, as usual, keenly and
      carefully, by his most sedulous and sympathetic medical attendant. It was
      counted by him just as keenly and carefully directly afterwards&mdash;the
      rise then apparent being something startling, almost alarming, as it
      seemed to us under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those twelve Farewell Readings are all the more to be regretted now when
      we come to look back at them, on our recalling to remembrance the fact
      that then, for the first time since he assumed to himself the position of
      a Public Reader professionally, Dickens consented to give a series of
      Readings at the very period when he was producing one of his imaginative
      works in monthly instalments. He appeared to give himself no rest
      whatever, when repose, at any rate for a while, was most urgently
      required. He seemed to have become his own taskmaster precisely at the
      time when he ought to have taken the repose he had long previously earned,
      by ministering so largely and laboriously to the world's enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summing up in a few words what has already been related in detail, one
      passing sentence may here recall to recollection the fact, that in
      addition to the various works produced by the Novelist during the last
      three lustres of his energetic life as a man of letters, he had
      personally, within that busy interval of fifteen years, given in round
      numbers at a moderate computation some 500 of these Public Readings&mdash;423
      in a strictly professional capacity, the rest, prior to 1858, purely out
      of motives of generosity, in his character as a practical philanthropist.
      In doing this he had addressed as many as five hundred enormous audiences,
      whose rapt attention he had always secured, and who had one and all of
      them, without exception, welcomed his coming and going with enthusiasm.
      During this period he had travelled over many thousands of miles, by
      railway and steam-packet. In a single tour, that of the winter of 1867 and
      1868, in America, he had appeared before upwards of 100,000 persons,
      earning, at the same time, over 200,000 dollars within an interval of very
      little more than four months altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, the circumstances surrounding the immediate close of this
      portion of the popular author's life, as a Public Reader of his own works,
      will be described when mention is made of his final appearance in St.
      James's Hall, on the night of his Farewell Reading. Before any particular
      reference is made, however, to that last evening, it may be advisable, as
      tending to make this record more complete, that there should now be
      briefly passed in review, one after another, those minor stories, and
      fragments of the larger stories, the simple recounting of which by his own
      lips yielded so much artistic delight to a great multitude of his
      contemporaries. Whatever may thus be remarked in regard to these Readings
      will be written at least from a vivid personal recollection; the writer,
      throughout, speaking, as before observed, from his intimate knowledge of
      the whole of this protracted episode in the life of the Novelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever aid to the memory besides might have been thought desirable, he
      has had ready to hand all through, in the marked copies of the very books
      from which the author read upon these occasions, or from which, at the
      least, he had the appearance of reading. For, especially towards the last,
      Charles Dickens hardly ever glanced, even momentarily, at the printed
      pages, simply turning the leaves mechanically as they lay open before him
      on the picturesque little reading-desk. Besides the Sixteen Readings
      actually given, there were Four others which were so far meditated that
      they were printed separately as &ldquo;Readings,&rdquo; though the reading copies of
      them that have been preserved, were never otherwise prepared by their
      author-compiler for representation. One of these the writer remembers
      suggesting to the Novelist, as a characteristic companion or contrast to
      Dr. Marigold,&mdash;meaning &ldquo;Mrs. Lirriper.&rdquo; Another, strange to say,&mdash;about
      the least likely of all his stories one would have thought to have been
      thus selected,&mdash;was &ldquo;The Haunted Man.&rdquo; A third was &ldquo;The Prisoner of
      the Bastile,&rdquo; which would, for certain, have been one of Dickens's most
      powerful delineations. The fourth, if only in remembrance of the Old
      Bailey attorney, Mr. Jaggers, of the convict Magwitch, and of Joe the
      blacksmith, the majority would probably have been disposed to regret
      almost more than Mrs. Lirriper. Though the lodging-house keeper would have
      been welcome, too, for her own sake, as who will not agree in saying, if
      merely out of a remembrance of the &ldquo;trembling lip&rdquo; put up towards her
      face, speaking of which the good motherly old soul exclaims, &ldquo;and I dearly
      kissed it;&rdquo; or, bearing in mind, another while, her preposterous
      reminiscence of the &ldquo;impertinent little cock-sparrow of a monkey whistling
      with dirty shoes on the clean steps, and playing the harp on the area
      railings with a hoop-stick.&rdquo; Actually given or only meditated, the whole
      of these twenty Readings&mdash;meaning the entire collection of the
      identical marked copies used by the Novelist himself on both sides of the
      Atlantic&mdash;have, for the verification of this retrospect, been placed
      for the time being in the writer's possession. Selecting from among them
      those merely which are familiar to the public, from their having been
      actually produced, he here proposes cursorily to glance one by one through
      the well-known series of Sixteen.

    <h2>
      THE CHRISTMAS CAROL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It can hardly be any matter for wonder that the &ldquo;Christmas Carol&rdquo; was,
      among all the Readings, the author's own especial favourite! That it was
      so, he showed from first to last unmistakeably. He began with it in 1853,
      and ended with it in 1870, upon the latter occasion appending to the long
      since abbreviated narrative, that other incomparable evidence of his
      powers as a humorist, &ldquo;The Trial from Pickwick.&rdquo; Whoever went for the
      first time to see and hear Charles Dickens read one or other of his
      writings, did well in selecting a night when he was going to relate his
      immortal ghost story of Christmas. In compliance with the well-known wish
      of the Novelist, the audience, as a rule, contrived to assemble and to
      have actually taken their places several minutes before the time fixed for
      the Reader's appearance upon the platform. Occasionally it happened,
      nevertheless, that a stray couple or so would be still drifting in, here
      and there, among the serried ranks of the stalls, when, book in hand, with
      a light step, a smile on his face, and a flower in his button-hole, the
      author had already rapidly advanced and taken his place before his
      quaintly constructed but graceful little reading-desk. Then it was,
      perhaps, at those very times, that a stranger to the whole scene regarded
      himself almost as under a personal obligation to these vexatious
      stragglers. For, until every one of them had quietly settled down, there
      stood the Novelist, cheerfully, patiently, glancing to the right and to
      the left, taking the bearings of his night's company, as one might say,
      with an air of the most perfect ease and self-possession. Whosoever,
      consequently, was in attendance there for the first time, had an
      opportunity, during any such momentary pause, of familiarising himself
      with the appearance of the famous writer, with whose books he had probably
      been intimately acquainted for years upon years previously, but whom until
      then he had never had the chance of beholding face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone, even to the illiterate wayfarers in the public streets, had, to
      a certain extent, long since come to know what manner of man Charles
      Dickens was by means of his widely-scattered photographs. But, there,
      better than any photograph, was the man himself,&mdash;the master of all
      English humorists, the most popular author during his own lifetime that
      ever existed; one whose stories for thirty years together had been read
      with tears and with laughter, and whose books had won for him personal
      affection, as well as fame and fortune. Anyone seeing him at those moments
      for the first time, would unquestionably think&mdash;How like he was to a
      very few indeed, how utterly unlike the vast majority of his countless
      cartes-de-visites! To the last there was the bright, animated, alert
      carriage of the head&mdash;phrenologically a noble head&mdash;physiognomically
      a noble countenance. Encountering him within a very few weeks of his
      death, Mr. Arthur Locker has said, &ldquo;I was especially struck with the
      brilliancy and vivacity of his eyes:&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;there seemed as much life
      and animation in them as in twenty ordinary pairs of eyes.&rdquo; Another keen
      observer, Mr. Arthur Helps, has in the same spirit exclaimed, &ldquo;What
      portrait can do justice to the frankness, kindness, and power of his
      eyes?&rdquo; None certainly that ever was painted by the pencil of the sunbeam,
      or by the brush of a Royal Academician. Fully to realise the capacity for
      indicating emotion latent in them, and informing his whole frame&mdash;his
      hands for example, in their every movement, being wonderfully expressive&mdash;those
      who attended these Readings soon came to know, that you had but to listen
      to his variable and profoundly sympathetic voice, and to watch the play of
      his handsome features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The different original characters introduced in his stories, when he read
      them, he did not simply describe, he impersonated: otherwise to put it,
      for whomsoever he spoke, he spoke in character. Thus, when everything was
      quiet in the crowded assembly, and when the ringing applause that always
      welcomed his appearance, but which he never by any chance acknowledged,
      had subsided&mdash;when he began: &ldquo;A Christmas Carol, in four staves.
      Stave one, Marley's Ghost. Marley was dead to begin with.&rdquo; Having
      remarked, yet further, that &ldquo;there was no doubt whatever about that,&rdquo; the
      register of his burial being signed by this functionary, that and the
      other&mdash;when he added, &ldquo;<i>Scrooge</i> signed it; and Scrooge's name
      was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to&rdquo;&mdash;Scrooge
      in the flesh was, through the very manner of the utterance of his name,
      brought vividly and upon the instant before the observant listener. &ldquo;Oh!
      but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, was Scrooge!&rdquo; <i>That</i>
      we knew instinctively, without there being any need whatever for our
      hearing one syllable of the description of him, admirably given in the
      book, but suppressed in the Reading, judiciously suppressed enough,
      because, for that matter, we saw and heard it without any necessity for
      its being explained. As one might say&mdash;quoting here a single morsel
      from the animated description of Scrooge, that was actually illustrated by
      Scrooge's impersonator&mdash;it all &ldquo;spoke out shrewdly in his grating
      voice!&rdquo; And it was thus, not merely with regard to the leading personages
      of the little acted drama, as, turn by turn, they were introduced;
      precisely the same artistic care was applied by the impersonating realist
      to the very least among the minor characters, filling in, so to speak,
      little incidental gaps in the background. A great fat man with a monstrous
      chin, for example, was introduced just momentarily in the briefest
      street-dialogue, towards the close of this very Reading, who had only to
      open his lips once or twice for an instant, yet whose individuality was in
      that instant or two so thoroughly realised, that he lives ever since then
      in the hearers' remembrance. When, in reply to some one's inquiry, as to
      what was the cause of Scrooge's (presumed) death?&mdash;this great fat man
      with the monstrous chin answered, with a yawn, in two words, &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo;&mdash;he
      was before us there, as real as life, as selfish, and as substantial. So
      was it also with the grey-haired rascal, Joe, of the rag-and-bottle shop;
      with Topper, when he pronounced himself, as a bachelor, to be &ldquo;a wretched
      outcast;&rdquo; with the Schoolmaster, when he &ldquo;glared on Master Scrooge with
      ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by
      shaking hands with him,&rdquo; all of whom were indicated by the merest touch or
      two, and yet each of whom was a living and breathing and speaking
      verisimilitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was produced, to begin with, however, a sense of exhilaration in the
      very manner with which Dickens commenced the Reading of one of his
      stories, and which was always especially noticeable in the instance of
      this particular ghost story of his about Christmas. The opening sentences
      were always given in those cheery, comfortable tones, indicative of a
      double relish on the part of a narrator&mdash;to wit, his own enjoyment of
      the tale he is going to relate, and his anticipation of the enjoyment of
      it by those who are giving him their attention. Occasionally, at any rate
      during the last few years, his voice was husky just at the commencement,
      but as he warmed to his work, with him at all times a genuine labour of
      love, everything of that kind disappeared almost at the first turn of the
      leaf. The genial inflections of the voice, curiously rising, in those
      first moments of the Reading, at the end of every sentence, there was
      simply no resisting. Had there been a wedding guest present, he would
      hardly have repined in not being able to obey the summons of the loud
      bassoon. The narrator had his will with one and all. However large and
      however miscellaneous the audience, from the front of the stalls to the
      back of the gallery, every one listened to the familiar words that fell
      from his lips, from the beginning to the end, with unflagging attention.
      There could be small room for marvel at this, however, in the instance of
      the &ldquo;Carol,&rdquo; on first reading which, Thackeray spoke of its author as that
      &ldquo;delightful genius!&rdquo; The <i>Edinburgh</i> editor, Lord Jeffrey, at the
      very same time, namely, towards the close of 1843, on the morrow of the
      little book's original publication, avowing, in no less glowing terms,
      that he had been nothing less than charmed by the exquisite apologue:
      &ldquo;chiefly,&rdquo; as he declared, &ldquo;for the genuine goodness which breathes all
      through it, and is the true inspiring angel by which its genius has been
      awakened.&rdquo; Never since he had first&mdash;and that but a very few years
      previously&mdash;taken pen in hand as a story-teller, had this &ldquo;delightful
      genius&rdquo; sat down in a happier vein for writing anything, than when he did
      so for the purpose of recounting how Scrooge was converted, by a series of
      ghostly apparitions, from the error of his utterly selfish way in life,
      until then, as a tough-skinned, ingrained curmudgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters and incidents, brought before us anew in the Reading, were all
      so cordially welcomed,&mdash;the former being such old friends, the latter
      so familiarly within our knowledge! Insomuch that many passages were,
      almost word for word, remembered by those who, nevertheless, listened as
      if curious to learn what might follow, yet who could readily, any one of
      them, have prompted the Reader, that is the Author himself, supposing by
      some rare chance he had happened, just for one moment, to be at fault. It
      is curious to observe, on turning over the leaves of the marked copy of
      this Reading, the sententious little marginal notes for his own guidance,
      jotted down by the hand of this wonderful master of elocutionary effect.
      &ldquo;Narrative&rdquo; is written on the side of p. 5 where Scrooge's office, on
      Christmas Eve, is described, just before mention is made of the Clerk's
      dismal little cell seeming to be &ldquo;a sort of tank,&rdquo; and of his fire being
      so small that it looked like &ldquo;one coal,&rdquo; and of his trying at last to warm
      himself by the candle, &ldquo;in which effort, not being a man of strong
      imagination, he failed.&rdquo; Again, &ldquo;Cheerful&rdquo; is penned on the side of p. 6,
      where Scrooge's Nephew comes in at a burst with &ldquo;A Merry Christmas, uncle!
      God save you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Scrooge's inhuman retort of &ldquo;Bah! humbug!&rdquo; not a word was added of
      the descriptive sentence immediately following. Admirable though every
      word of it is, however, one could hardly regret its suppression. Is it
      asked why? Well then, for this simple reason&mdash;the force of which will
      be admitted by anyone who ever had the happiness of grasping Charles
      Dickens's hand in friendship&mdash;that his description of Scrooge's
      Nephew was, quite unconsciously but most accurately, in every word of it,
      a literal description of himself, just as he looked upon any day in the
      blithest of all seasons, after a brisk walk in the wintry streets or on
      the snowy high road. &ldquo;He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the
      fog and frost, this Nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his
      face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked
      again.&rdquo; The Novelist himself was depicted there to a nicety. No need,
      therefore, was there for even one syllable of this in the Reading.
      Scrooge's Nephew was visibly before us, without a word being uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      To our thinking, it has always seemed as if the one chink through which
      Scrooge's sympathies are got at and his heart-strings are eventually
      touched, is discernable in his keen sense of humour from the very outset.
      It is precisely through this that there seems hope, from the very
      beginning, of his proving to be made of &ldquo;penetrable stuff.&rdquo; When, after
      his monstrous &ldquo;Out upon merry Christmas!&rdquo; he goes on to say, &ldquo;If I had my
      will every idiot who goes about with 'merry Christmas' on his lips should
      be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly in his
      heart: he should!&rdquo; one almost feels as if he were laughing in his sleeve
      from the very commencement. Instance, as yet more strikingly to the point
      in respect to what we are here maintaining, the wonderfully comic effect
      of the bantering remarks addressed by him to the Ghost of Jacob Marley all
      through their confabulation, even when the spectre's voice, as we are
      told, was disturbing the very marrow in his bones. True, it is there
      stated that, all through that portentous dialogue, he was only trying to
      be smart &ldquo;as a means of distracting his own attention.&rdquo; But the jests
      themselves are too delicious, one would say, for mere make-believes.
      Besides which, hear his laugh at the end of the book! Hardly that of one
      really so long out of practice&mdash;&ldquo;a splendid laugh, a most illustrious
      laugh, the father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!&rdquo; A laugh, one
      might suppose, as contagious as that of his own Nephew when he was &ldquo;so
      inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and
      stamp!&rdquo; Speaking of which our author writes so delectably, &ldquo;If you should
      happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blest in a laugh than
      Scrooge's Nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too.
      Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.&rdquo; At which
      challenge one might almost have been tempted anticipatively to say at a
      venture&mdash;Scrooge! Good-humoured argument apart, however, what
      creatures were those who, one by one&mdash;sometimes, it almost seemed,
      two or three of them together&mdash;appeared and disappeared upon the
      platform, at the Reader's own good-will and pleasure!
    </p>
    <p>
      After Scrooge's &ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo;&mdash;delivered with irresistibly
      ludicrous iteration&mdash;we caught something more than a distant glimpse
      of the Clerk in the tank, when&mdash;on Scrooge's surly interrogation, if
      he will want all day to-morrow?&mdash;the Reader replied in the thinnest
      and meekest of frightened voices, &ldquo;If quite convenient, sir!&rdquo; It brought
      into full view instantaneously, and for the first time, the little Clerk
      whom one followed in imagination with interest a minute afterwards on his
      &ldquo;going down a slide at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of
      Christmas, and then, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling
      below his waist (for he boasted no greatcoat) running home as hard as he
      could pelt to play at blind man's buff.&rdquo; Instantly, upon the heels of
      this, we find noted on the margin, p. 18, &ldquo;Tone to mystery.&rdquo; The spectral
      illusion of the knocker on Scrooge's house-door, looking for all the world
      not like a knocker, but like Marley's face, &ldquo;with a dismal light about it
      like a bad lobster in a dark cellar,&rdquo; prepared the way marvellously for
      what followed. Numberless little tid-bits of description that anybody else
      would have struck out with reluctance, as, for instance, that of Scrooge
      looking cautiously behind the street door when he entered, &ldquo;as if he half
      expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out
      into the hall,&rdquo; were unhesitatingly erased by the Reader, as, from his
      point of view, not necessarily to the purpose. Then, after the goblin
      incident of the disused bell slowly oscillating until it and all the other
      bells in the house rang loudly for a while&mdash;afterwards becoming in
      turn just as suddenly hushed&mdash;we got to the clanking approach, from
      the sub-basement of the old building, of the noise that at length came on
      through the heavy door of Scrooge's apartment! &ldquo;And&rdquo;&mdash;as the Reader
      said with startling effect, while his voice rose to a hurried outcry as he
      uttered the closing exclamation&mdash;&ldquo;upon its coming in, the dying flame
      leaped up, as though it cried, '<i>I know him! Marley's Ghost!</i>'&rdquo; The
      apparition, although the description of it was nearly stenographically
      abbreviated in the Reading, appeared to be, in a very few words, no less
      startlingly realised. &ldquo;Same face, usual waistcoat, tights, boots,&rdquo; even to
      the spectral illusion being so transparent that Scrooge (his own marrow,
      then, we may presume, becoming sensitized) looking through his waistcoat
      &ldquo;could see the two back buttons on the coat behind&rdquo;&mdash;with the
      incorrigible old joker's cynical reflection to himself that &ldquo;he had often
      heard Marley spoken of as having no bowels, but had never believed it
      until then.&rdquo; The grotesque humour of his interview with the spectre seemed
      scarcely to have been realised, in fact, until their colloquy was actually
      listened to in the Reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scrooge's entreaty addressed to the Ghost, when the latter demanded a
      hearing, &ldquo;Don't be flowery, Jacob, pray!&rdquo; was only less laughable, for
      example, than the expression of the old dreamer's visage when Marley
      informed him that he had often sat beside him invisibly! Promised a chance
      and hope in the fixture&mdash;a chance and hope of his dead partner's
      procuring&mdash;Scrooge's &ldquo;Thank 'ee!&rdquo;&mdash;full of doubt&mdash;was a
      fitting prelude to his acknowledgment of the favour when explained. &ldquo;You
      will be haunted,&rdquo; quoth the Ghost, &ldquo;by three Spirits.&rdquo; The other
      faltering, &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I'd rather not:&rdquo; and then quietly hinting
      afterwards, &ldquo;Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for the revelations made to Ebenezer Scrooge by those three memorable
      Spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, who can ever hope to
      relate them and impersonate them as they were related and impersonated by
      the Author himself of this peerless ghost-story! Fezziwig, for example,
      with his calves shining like moons, who, after going through all the
      intricacies of the country dance, bow, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and
      back again to your place, cut&mdash;&ldquo;cut so deftly that he appeared to
      wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger!&rdquo; The
      very Fiddler, who &ldquo;went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it,
      and tuned like fifty stomach-aches!&rdquo; Master Peter Cratchit, again, arrayed
      in his father's shirt collars, who, rejoicing to find himself so gallantly
      attired, at one moment &ldquo;yearned to show his linen in the fashionable
      parks,&rdquo; and at another, hearing his sister Martha talk of some lord who
      &ldquo;was much about as tall as Peter, pulled up his collars so high that you
      couldn't have seen him if you had been there.&rdquo; As for the pathetic
      portions of the narrative, it is especially observable in regard to those,
      that they were anything rather than made too much of. There, more
      particularly, the elisions were ruthless. Looking through the marked copy,
      it really would appear that only a very few indeed of the salient points
      were left in regard to the life and death of Tiny Tim. Bob's visit to the
      death-bed was entirely unmentioned. Even the words &ldquo;Spirit of Tiny Tim,
      thy childish essence was from God!&rdquo; were never uttered. Two utterances
      there <i>were</i>, however, the one breathing an exquisite tenderness, the
      other indicative of a long-suppressed but passionate outburst of grief,
      that thrilled to the hearts of all who heard them, and still, we doubt
      not, haunt their recollection. The one&mdash;where the mother, laying her
      mourning needlework upon the table, put her hand up to her face. &ldquo;'The
      colour hurts my eyes,' she said. The colour? Ah! poor Tiny Tim!&rdquo; The
      other, where the father, while describing the little creature's grave,
      breaks down in a sudden agony of tears. &ldquo;It would have done you good to
      see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that
      I would walk there on a Sunday&mdash;<i>My little, little child! My little
      child!</i>&rdquo; It was a touch of nature that made the Reader and his world of
      hearers, upon the instant, kin. The tearful outcry brimmed to the eyes of
      those present a thousand visible echoes. &ldquo;He broke down all at once. He
      couldn't help it,&rdquo; said the Reader, adding in subdued accents the simple
      words, &ldquo;If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been
      further apart perhaps than they were.&rdquo; With that ended all reference to
      the home-grief at Bob Cratchit's. Everything else in relation to the loss
      of Tiny Tim was foregone unhesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descriptive passages were cut out by wholesale. While the Christmas
      dinner at Scrooge's Clerk's, and the Christmas party at Scrooge's
      Nephew's, were left in almost in their entirety, the street-scenes and
      shop-window displays were obliterated altogether. Nothing at all was said
      about the &ldquo;great round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the
      waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling into
      the streets in their apoplectic opulence.&rdquo; Nothing about the ruddy,
      brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their
      growth like Spanish friars, and &ldquo;winking from their shelves in wanton
      slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up
      mistletoe.&rdquo; Nothing about the canisters of tea and coffee &ldquo;rattled up and
      down like juggling tricks,&rdquo; or about the candied fruits, &ldquo;so caked and
      spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint,
      and subsequently bilious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nay, we were denied even a momentary glimpse, on the snow-crusted pavement
      at nightfall, of that group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,
      and all chattering at once, tripping lightly off to some near neighbour's
      house, &ldquo;where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter&mdash;artful
      witches, well they knew it&mdash;in a glow!&rdquo; Topper was there, however,
      and the plump sister in the lace tucker, and the game of Yes-and-No, the
      solution to which was, &ldquo;It's your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!&rdquo; Happiest of all
      these non-omissions, as one may call them, there was that charming picture
      of Scrooge's niece by marriage, which&mdash;as brightly, exquisitely
      articulated by the lips of her imaginer&mdash;was like the loveliest
      girl-portrait ever painted by Greuze. &ldquo;She was very pretty, exceedingly
      pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little
      mouth, that seemed made to be kissed&mdash;as no doubt it was; all kinds
      of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she
      laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little
      creature's head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking,
      you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.&rdquo; The grave
      face and twinkling eyes with which this cordial acquiescence in the
      conclusion arrived at was expressed were irresistibly exhilarating. Just
      in the same way there was a sort of parenthetical smack of the lips in the
      self-communing of Scrooge when, at the very close of the story, after
      hesitating awhile at his Nephew's door as to whether he should knock, he
      made a dash and did it. &ldquo;Is your master at home, my dear?&rdquo; said Scrooge. &ldquo;<i>Nice
      girl! very.</i>&rdquo; Then, as to the cordiality of his reception by his
      Nephew, what could by possibility have expressed it better than the look,
      voice, manner of the Reader. &ldquo;'Will you let me in, Fred?' <i>Let him in!
      It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.</i>&rdquo; The turkey that &ldquo;never
      could have stood upon its legs, that bird,&rdquo; but must have &ldquo;snapped 'em
      short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing-wax!&rdquo;&mdash;the remarkable
      boy who was just about its size, and who, when told to go and buy it,
      cried out &ldquo;Walk-ER!&rdquo;&mdash;Bob Cratchit's trying to overtake nine o'clock
      with his pen on his arriving nearly twenty minutes afterwards; his
      trembling and getting a little nearer the ruler when regenerated Scrooge
      talks about raising his salary, prior to calling him Bob, and, with a clap
      on the back, wishing him a merry Christmas!&mdash;brought, hilariously,
      the whole radiant Reading of this wonderful story to its conclusion. It
      was a feast of humour and a flow of fun, better than all the yule-tide
      fare that ever was provided&mdash;fuller of good things than any Christmas
      pudding of plums and candied fruit-peel&mdash;more warming to the cockles
      of one's heart, whatever those may be, than the mellowest wassail-bowl
      ever brimmed to over-flowing. No wonder those two friends of Thackeray,
      who have been already mentioned, and who were both of them women, said of
      the Author of the &ldquo;Carol,&rdquo; by way of criticism, &ldquo;God bless him!&rdquo; This
      being exclaimed by them, as will be remembered, simply after reading it to
      themselves. If only they had heard him read it!

    <h2>
      THE TRIAL FROM PICKWICK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reader and audience about equally, one may say, revelled in the &ldquo;Trial
      from Pickwick.&rdquo; Every well-known person in the comic drama was looked for
      eagerly, and when at last Serjeant Buzfuz, as we were told, &ldquo;rose with
      more importance than he had yet exhibited, if that were possible, and
      said, 'Call Samuel Weller,'&rdquo; a round of applause invariably greeted the
      announcement of perhaps the greatest of all Dickens's purely humorous
      characters. The Reading copy of this abbreviated report of the great case
      of <i>Bardell v. Pickwick</i> has, among the complete set of Readings, one
      very striking peculiarity. Half-bound in scarlet morocco like all the
      other thin octavos in the collection, its leaves though yellow and worn
      with constant turning like the rest, are wholly <i>un</i>like those of the
      others in this, that the text is untouched by pen or pencil. Beyond the
      first condensation of that memorable 34th chapter of Pickwick, there is
      introduced not one single alteration by way of after-thought. Struck off
      at a heat, as it was, that first humorous report of the action for breach
      of promise of marriage brought by Martha Bardell against Samuel Pickwick
      admitted in truth in no way whatever of improvement. Anything like a
      textual change would have been resented by the hearers&mdash;every one of
      them Pickwickian, as the case might be, to a man, woman, or child&mdash;as
      in the estimation of the literary court, nothing less than a high crime
      and misdemeanour. Once epitomised for the Reading, the printed version, at
      least of the report, was left altogether intact. Nevertheless, strange to
      say, there was perhaps no Reading out of the whole series of sixteen, in
      the delivery of which the Author more readily indulged himself with an
      occasional gag. Every interpolation of this kind, however, was so
      obviously introduced on the spur of the moment, so refreshingly
      spontaneous and so ludicrously <i>apropos</i>, that it was always cheered
      to the very echo, or, to put the fact not conventionally but literally,
      was received with peals of laughter. Thus it was in one instance, as we
      very well remember, in regard to Mr. Justice Stareleigh&mdash;upon every
      occasion that we saw him, one of the Reader's most whimsical
      impersonations. The little judge&mdash;described in the book as &ldquo;all face
      and waistcoat&rdquo;&mdash;was presented to view upon the platform as evidently
      with no neck at all (to speak of), and as blinking with owl-like stolidity
      whenever he talked, which he always did under his voice, and with
      apparently a severe cold in the head. On the night more particularly
      referred to, Sam Weller, being at the moment in the witness-box, had just
      replied to the counsel's suggestion, that what he (Sam) meant by calling
      Mr. Pickwick's &ldquo;a very good service&rdquo; was &ldquo;little to do and plenty to get.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      quite enough to get, sir, as the soldier said ven they ordered him three
      hundred and fifty lashes.&rdquo; Thereupon&mdash;glowering angrily at Sam, and
      blinking his eyes more than ever&mdash;Mr. Justice Stareleigh remarked,
      with a heavier cold in the head than hitherto, in a severe monotone, and
      with the greatest deliberation, &ldquo;You must not tell us what the soldier
      says unless the soldier is in court, unless that soldier comes here in
      uniform, and is examined in the usual way&mdash;it's not evidence.&rdquo;
       Another evening, again, we recall quite as clearly to mind, when the
      Reader was revelling more even than was his wont, in the fun of this
      representation of the trial-scene, he suddenly seemed to open up the
      revelation of an entirely new phase in Mr. Winkle's idiosyncrasy. Under
      the badgering of Mr. Skimpin's irritating examination, as to whether he
      was or was not a particular friend of Mr. Pickwick the defendant, the
      usually placable Pickwickian's patience upon this occasion appeared
      gradually and at last utterly to forsake him. &ldquo;I have known Mr. Pickwick
      now, as well as I can recollect at this moment, nearly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Winkle, do not evade the question. Are you or are you not a
      particular friend of the defendant's?&rdquo; &ldquo;I was just about to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Will you, or will you not, answer my question, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, God bless my
      soul, I was just about to say that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Whereupon the
      Court, otherwise Mr. Justice Stareleigh, blinking faster than ever,
      blurted out severely, &ldquo;If you don't answer the question you'll be
      committed to prison, sir!&rdquo; And then, but not till then, Mr. Winkle was
      sufficiently restored to equanimity to admit at last, meekly, &ldquo;Yes, he
      was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the Reading of the Trial the first droll touch was the well-remembered
      reference to the gentlemen in wigs, in the barristers' seats, presenting
      as a body &ldquo;all that pleasing variety of nose and whisker for which the bar
      of England is so justly celebrated.&rdquo; Even the allusion to those among
      their number who carried a brief &ldquo;scratching their noses with it to
      impress the fact more strongly on the observation of the spectators,&rdquo; and
      the other allusion to those who hadn't a brief, carrying instead
      red-labelled octavos with &ldquo;that under-done-pie-crust cover, technically
      known as law calf,&rdquo; was each, in turn, welcomed with a flutter of
      amusement. Every point, however minute, told, and told eifectively. More
      eifectively than if each was heard for the first time, because all were
      thoroughly known, and, therefore, thoroughly well appreciated. The opening
      address of Serjeant Buzfuz every one naturally enough regarded as one of
      the most mirth-moving portions of the whole representation. In the very
      exordium of it there was something eminently absurd in the Serjeant's
      extraordinarily precise, almost mincing pronunciation. As where he said,
      that &ldquo;never in the whole course of his professional experience&mdash;never
      from the first moment of his applying himself to the study and practice of
      the law&mdash;had he approached a case with such a heavy sense of
      respon-see-bee-lee-ty imposed upon him&mdash;a respon-see-bee-lee-ty he
      could never have supported were he not,&rdquo; and so forth. Again, a
      wonderfully ridiculous effect was imparted by the Reader to his mere
      contrasts of manner when, at one moment, in the bland and melancholy
      accents of Serjeant Buzfuz, he referred to the late Mr. Bardell as having
      &ldquo;glided almost imperceptibly from the world to seek elsewhere for that
      repose and peace which a custom-house can never afford,&rdquo; adding, the next
      instant in his own voice, and with the most cruelly matter-of-fact
      precision, &ldquo;This was a pathetic description of the decease of Mr. Bardell,
      who had been knocked on the head with a quart-pot in a public-house
      cellar.&rdquo; The gravity of the Reader's countenance at these moments, with,
      now and then, but very rarely, a lurking twinkle in the eye, was of itself
      irresistibly provocative of laughter. Even upon the Serjeant's mention of
      the written placard hung up in the parlour window of Goswell Street,
      bearing this inscription, &ldquo;Apartments furnished for single gentlemen:
      inquire within,&rdquo; the sustained seriousness with which he added, that there
      the forensic orator paused while several gentlemen of the jury &ldquo;took a
      note of the document,&rdquo; one of that intelligent body inquiring, &ldquo;There is
      no date to that, is there, sir?&rdquo; made fresh ripples of laughter spread
      from it as inevitably as the concentric circles on water from the dropping
      of a pebble. The crowning extravagances of this most Gargantuan of comic
      orations were always of course the most eagerly welcomed, such, for
      example, as the learned Serjeant's final allusion to Pickwick's coming
      before the court that day with &ldquo;his heartless tomato-sauce and
      warming-pans,&rdquo; and the sonorous close of the impassioned peroration with
      the plaintiff's appeal to &ldquo;an enlightened, a high-minded, a right-feeling,
      a conscientious, a dispassionate, a sympathising, a contemplative jury of
      her civilised countrymen.&rdquo; It was after this, however, that the true fun
      of the Reading began with the examination and cross-examination of the
      different witnesses. These, as a matter of course, were acted, not
      described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cluppins first entered the box, with her feelings, so far as they
      could be judged from her voice, evidently all but too many for her. Her
      fluttered reply showed this at the very commencement, in answer to an
      inquiry as to whether she remembered one particular morning in July last,
      when Mrs. Bar-dell was dusting Pickwick's apartment. &ldquo;Yes, my lord and
      jury, I do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Was that sitting-room the first-floor front?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it were,
      sir&rdquo;&mdash;something in the manner of Mrs. Crupp when at her faintest. The
      suspicious inquiry of the red-faced little Judge, &ldquo;What were you doing in
      the back-room, ma'am?&rdquo; followed&mdash;on her replying lackadaisically, &ldquo;My
      lord and jury, I will not deceive you&rdquo;&mdash;by his blinking at her more
      fiercely, &ldquo;You had better not, ma'am,&rdquo; were only exceeded in comicality by
      Justice Stare-leigh's bewilderment a moment afterwards, upon her saying
      that she &ldquo;see Mrs. Bardell's street-door on the jar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge (in immense astonishment).&mdash;&ldquo;On the what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Counsel.&mdash;&ldquo;Partly open, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge (with more owl-like stolidity than ever).&mdash;&ldquo;She said on the
      jar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Counsel.&mdash;&ldquo;It's all the same, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;blinking more quickly than before, with a furtive glance at
      witness, and a doubtful look of abstraction into space&mdash;the little
      Judge made a note of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in Mrs. Cluppins' faintness there was a recognizable touch of Mrs.
      Crupp, when the spasms were engendering in the nankeen bosom of that
      exemplary female, so also in the maternal confidences volunteered by the
      same witness, there was an appreciable reminder of another lady who will
      be remembered as having been introduced at the Coroner's Inquest in Bleak
      House as &ldquo;Anastasia Piper, gentlemen.&rdquo; Regarding that as a favourable
      opportunity for informing the court of her own domestic affairs, through
      the medium of a brief dissertation, Mrs. Cluppins was interrupted by the
      irascible Judge at the most interesting point in her revelations, when,
      having mentioned that she was already the mother of eight children, she
      added, that &ldquo;she entertained confident expectations of presenting Mr.
      Cluppins with a ninth about that day six months&rdquo;&mdash;whereupon the
      worthy lady was summarily hustled out of the witness-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathaniel Winkle, however, consoled us immediately. Don't we remember how,
      even before he could open his lips, he was completely disconcerted?
      Namely, when, bowing very respectfully to the little Judge, he had that
      complimentary proceeding acknowledged snappishly with, &ldquo;Don't look at me,
      sir; look at the jury&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Winkle, in obedience to the
      mandate, meekly looking &ldquo;at the place where he thought that the jury might
      be.&rdquo; Don't we remember also perfectly well how the worst possible
      construction was cast by implication beforehand upon his probable reply to
      the very first question put to him, namely, by the mere manner in which
      that first question was put? &ldquo;Now, sir, have the goodness to let his
      lordship and the jury know what your name is, will you?&rdquo; Mr. Skimpin, in
      propounding this inquiry, inclining his head on one side and listening
      with great sharpness for the answer, &ldquo;as if to imply that he rather
      thought Mr. Winkle's natural taste for perjury would induce him to give
      some name which did not belong to him.&rdquo; Giving in, absurdly, his surname
      only; and being asked immediately afterwards, if possible still more
      absurdly, by the Judge, &ldquo;Have you any Christian name, sir?&rdquo; the witness,
      in the Reading, more naturally and yet more confusedly even it seemed than
      in the book, got that eminent functionary into a great bewilderment as to
      whether he (Mr. Winkle) were called Nathaniel Daniel, or Daniel Nathaniel.
      Bewildered himself, in his turn, and that too almost hopelessly, came Mr.
      Winkle's reply, &ldquo;No, my lord; only Nathaniel&mdash;not Daniel at all.&rdquo;
       Irascibly, the Judge's, &ldquo;What did you tell me it was Daniel for, then,
      sir?&rdquo; Shamefaced and yet irritably, &ldquo;I didn't, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;You did, sir!&rdquo;&mdash;with
      great indignation, topped by this cogent reasoning,&mdash;&ldquo;How could I
      have got Daniel on my notes, unless you told me so, sir?&rdquo; Nothing at all
      was said about it in the Reading; but, again and again, Mr. Winkle, as
      there impersonated, while endeavouring to feign an easiness of manner, was
      made to assume, in his then state of confusion, &ldquo;rather the air of a
      disconcerted pickpocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Better almost than Mr. Winkle himself, however, as an impersonation, was,
      in look, voice, manner, Mr. Skimpin, the junior barrister, under whose
      cheerful but ruthless interrogations that unfortunate gentleman was
      stretched upon the rack of examination. His (Mr. Skimpin's) cheery echoing&mdash;upon
      every occasion when it was at last extorted from his victim&mdash;of the
      latter's answer (followed instantly by his own taunts and insinuations),
      remains as vividly as anything at all about this Reading in our
      recollection. When at length Mr. Winkle, with no reluctance in the world,
      but only seemingly with reluctance, answers the inquiry as to whether he
      is a particular friend of Pickwick, &ldquo;Yes, I am!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, you are!&rdquo;
       said Mr. Skimpin (audibly to the court, but as if it were only to
      himself). &ldquo;And why couldn't you say that at once, sir? Perhaps you know
      the plaintiff, too&mdash;eh, Mr. Winkle?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't know her; I've seen
      her!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, <i>you don't know her, but you've seen her!</i> Now have the
      goodness to tell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by <i>that</i>,
      Mr. Winkle.&rdquo; As to how this unfortunate witness, after being driven to the
      confines of desperation, on being at last released, &ldquo;rushed with delirious
      haste&rdquo; to the hotel, &ldquo;where he was discovered some hours after by the
      waiter, groaning in a hollow and dismal manner, with his head buried
      beneath the sofa cushions&rdquo;&mdash;not a word was said in the Reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flavour of the fun of Mrs. Sanders's evidence was given, but only a
      passing flavour of it, in reference to Mr. Sanders having, in the course
      of their correspondence, often called her duck, but never chops, nor yet
      tomato-sauce&mdash;he being particularly fond of ducks&mdash;though
      possibly, if he had been equally fond of chops and tomato-sauce, he might
      have called her that instead, as a term of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The</i> evidence of all, however, was that of Sam Weller, no less to
      the enjoyment of the Author, it was plain to see, than to that of his
      hearers. After old Weller's hoarse and guttural cry from the gallery, &ldquo;Put
      it down a wee, my lord,&rdquo; in answer to the inquiry whether the immortal
      surname was to be spelt with a V. or a W.; Sam's quiet &ldquo;I rayther suspect
      it was my father, my lord,&rdquo; came with irresistible effect from the Reader,
      as also did his recollection of something &ldquo;wery partickler&rdquo; having
      happened on the memorable morning, out of which had sprung the whole of
      this trial of Bardell v. Pickwick, namely, that he himself that day had &ldquo;a
      reg'lar new fit out o' clothes.&rdquo; Beyond all the other Wellerisms, however,
      was Sam's overwhelmingly conclusive answer to counsel's inquiry in regard
      to his not having seen what occurred, though he himself, at the time, was
      in the passage, &ldquo;Have you a pair of eyes, Mr. Weller?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I <i>have</i>
      a pair of eyes; and that's just it If they wos a pair o' patent
      double-million magnifying gas microscopes of hextra power, p'r'aps I might
      be able to see through two flights o' stairs and a deal door; but <i>bein''</i>
      only eyes, you see, my wision's limited.&rdquo; Better by far, in our
      estimation, nevertheless, than the smart Cockney facetiousness of the
      inimitable Sam; better than the old coachman's closing lamentation, &ldquo;Vy
      worn't there a alleybi?&rdquo; better than Mr. Winkle, or Mrs. Cluppins, or
      Serjeant Buzfuz, or than all the rest of those engaged in any capacity in
      the trial, put together, was the irascible little Judge, with the blinking
      eyes and the monotonous voice&mdash;himself, in his very <i>pose</i>,
      obviously, &ldquo;all face and waistcoat.&rdquo; Than Mr. Justice Stareleigh there
      was, in the whole of this most humorous of all the Readings, no more
      highly comic impersonation.

    <h2>
      DAVID COPPERFIELD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sea-beach at Yarmouth formed both the opening and the closing scene of
      this Reading, in six chapters, from &ldquo;David Copperfield.&rdquo; In its varied
      portraiture of character and in the wonderful descriptive power marking
      its conclusion, it was one of the most interesting and impressive of the
      whole series in its delivery. Through it, we renewed our acquaintance more
      vividly than ever with handsome, curry-headed, reckless, heartless
      Steerforth! With poor, lone, lorn Mrs. Gummidge, not only when everythink
      about her went contrairy, but when her better nature gushed forth under
      the great calamity befalling her benefactor. With pretty little Emily, and
      bewitching little Dora. With Mr. Micawber, his shirt-collar, his
      eye-glass, the condescending roll in his voice, and his intermittent
      bursts of confidence. With Mrs. Micawber, who, as the highest praise we
      can bestow upon her, is quite worthy of her husband, and who is always, it
      will be remembered, so impassioned in her declaration that, come what may,
      she never <i>will</i> desert Mr. Micawber! With Traddles, and his
      irrepressible hair, even a love-lock from which had to be kept down by
      Sophy's preservation of it in a clasped locket! With Mr. Peggotty, in
      fine, who, in his tender love for his niece, is, according to his own
      account, &ldquo;not to-look at, but to think on,&rdquo; nothing less than a babby in
      the form of a great sea Porkypine! Remembering the other originals,
      crowding the pages of the story in its integrity, how one would have liked
      to have seen even a few more of them impersonated by the protean Novelist!
      That &ldquo;most wonderful woman in the world,&rdquo; Aunt Betsey, for example; or
      that most laconic of carriers, Mr. Barkis; or, to name yet one other,
      Uriah Heep, that reddest and most writhing of rascally attornies. As it
      was, however, there were abundant realizations within the narrow compass
      of this Reading of the principal persons introduced in the autobiography
      of David Copperfield. The most loveable, by the way, of all the young
      heroes portrayed in the Dickens' Gallery was there, to begin with, for
      example&mdash;the peculiar loveableness of David being indicated as
      plainly as by any means through the extraordinary variety of pet names
      given to him by one or another in the course of the narrative. For, was he
      not the &ldquo;Daisy&rdquo; of Steerforth, the &ldquo;Doady&rdquo; of Dora, the &ldquo;Trotwood&rdquo; of Aunt
      Betsy, and the &ldquo;Mas'r Davy&rdquo; of the Yarmouth boatmen, just as surely as he
      was the &ldquo;Mr. Copper-full&rdquo; of Mrs. Crupp, the &ldquo;Master Copperfield&rdquo; of Uriah
      Heep, and the &ldquo;Dear Copperfield&rdquo; of Mr. Wilkins Micawber?
    </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;The Personal History and Experiences of David Copperfield the
      Younger&rdquo; was, among all its author's works, his own particular favourite,
      he himself, in his very last preface to it, in 1867, formally
      acknowledged. Several years previously, while sauntering with him to and
      fro one evening on the grass-plot at Gadshill, we remember receiving from
      him that same admission. &ldquo;Which of all your books do you think I regard as
      incomparably your best?&rdquo; &ldquo;Which?&rdquo; &ldquo;David Copperfield.&rdquo; A momentary pause
      ensuing, he added, readily and without the smallest reservation, &ldquo;You are
      quite right.&rdquo; The acknowledgment then made as to this being in fact his
      own opinion was thus simply but emphatically expressed. Pen in hand, long
      afterwards, he made the same admission, only with yet greater emphasis,
      when the Preface to the new edition of the story in 1867 was thus closed
      by Charles Dickens&mdash;&ldquo;Of all my books, I like this the best. It will
      be easily believed that I am a fond parent to every child of my fancy, and
      that no one can ever love that family as dearly as I love them. But, like
      many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his
      name is 'David Copperfield.'&rdquo; Having that confession from his own lips and
      under his own hand, it will be readily understood that the Novelist always
      took an especial delight when, in the course of his Readings, the turn
      came for that of &ldquo;David Copperfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the keenest sensations of pleasure he ever experienced as a Reader&mdash;as
      he himself related to us with the liveliest gratification, evidently, even
      in the mere recollection of the incident&mdash;occurred in connection with
      this very Reading. Strange to say, moreover, it occurred, not in England
      or in America, in the presence of an English-speaking audience, but in
      Paris, and face to face with an audience more than half of which was
      composed of Frenchmen. And the hearer who caused him, there, that artistic
      sense, one might almost call it thrill of satisfaction&mdash;-was a
      Frenchman! All that was expressed on the part of this appreciative
      listener, being uttered by him instantaneously in a half-whispered,
      monosyllabic ejaculation. As we have already explained upon an earlier
      page, the Readings which took place in Paris, and which were in behalf of
      the British Charitable Fund in that capital, were given there before a
      densely crowded but very select audience at the British Embassy, Lord
      Cowley being then her Majesty's ambassador. The Reading on the occasion
      referred to was &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; and the Reader became aware in the
      midst of the hushed silence, just after he had been saying, in the voice
      of Steerforth, giving at the same moment a cordial grasp of the hand to
      the briny fisherman he was addressing: &ldquo;Mr. Peggotty, you are a thoroughly
      good fellow, and deserve to be as happy as you are to-night. My hand upon
      it!&rdquo; when, turning round, he added, still as Steerforth, but speaking in a
      very different voice and offering a very different hand-grip, as though
      already he were thinking to himself what a chuckle-headed fellow the young
      shipwright was&mdash;&ldquo;Ham, I give you joy, my boy. My hand upon that too!&rdquo;
       The always keenly observant Novelist became aware of a Frenchman, who was
      eagerly listening in the front row of the stalls, suddenly exclaiming to
      himself, under his breath, &ldquo;Ah&mdash;h!&rdquo;&mdash;having instantly caught the
      situation! The sound of that one inarticulate monosyllable, as he
      observed, when relating the circumstance, gave the Reader, as an artist, a
      far livelier sense of satisfaction than any that could possibly have been
      imparted by mere acclamations, no matter how spontaneous or enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Reading, it always seemed to us, that &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; was cut
      down rather distressingly. That, nevertheless, was unavoidable. Turning in
      off Yarmouth sands, we went straight at once through the &ldquo;delightful door&rdquo;
       cut in its side, into the old black barge or boat, high and dry there on
      the sea-beach, and which was known to us nearly as familiarly as to David
      himself, as the odd dwelling-house inhabited by Mr. Peggotty. All the
      still-life of that beautifully clean and tidy interior we had revealed to
      us again, as of old: lockers, boxes, table, Dutch clock, chest of drawers&mdash;even
      tea-tray, only that we failed to hear anything said about the painting on
      the tea-tray, representing &ldquo;a lady with a parasol, taking a walk with a
      military-looking child, who was trundling a hoop.&rdquo; The necessities of
      condensation in the same way restricted the definition of Mr. Peggotty's
      occupation in the Reading, to the simple mention of the fact that he dealt
      in lobsters, crabs, and craw-fish, without any explanation at all as to
      those creatures being heaped together in a little wooden out-house &ldquo;in a
      state of wonderful conglomeration with one another, and never leaving off
      pinching whatever they laid hold of.&rdquo; Little Emily appeared as a beautiful
      young woman, and no longer as the prattling lassie who, years before had
      confided to her playfellow, David, how, if ever she were a lady, she would
      give uncle Dan, meaning Mr. Peggotty, &ldquo;a sky-blue coat, with diamond
      buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a cocked hat, a large
      gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money.&rdquo; Mrs. Gummidge, as became a
      faithful widow, was still fretting after the Old 'Un. Ham, something of
      Mr. Peggotty's own build, as the latter described him, &ldquo;a good deal o' the
      sou-wester in him, wery salt, but on the whole, a honest sort of a chap,
      too, with his 'art in the right place,&rdquo; had just made good his betrothal
      to the little creature he had seen grow up there before him, &ldquo;like a
      flower,&rdquo; when, at the very opening of the Reading, into the old Yarmouth
      boat, walked &ldquo;Mas'r Davy&rdquo; and his friend Steerforth. Mr. Peggotty's
      explanation to his unexpected but heartily welcomed visitors as to how the
      engagement between Ham and Emily, had but just then been brought about,
      opened up before the audience in a few words the whole scheme of the
      tragic little dramatic tale about to be revealed to them through a series
      of vivid impersonations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idiomatic sentences of the bluff fisherman, as in their racy
      vernacular they were blithely given utterance to by the manly voice of the
      Reader, seemed to supply a fitting introduction to the drama, as though
      from the lips of a Yarmouth Chorus. Scarcely had the social carouse there
      in the old boat, on that memorable evening of Steerforth's introduction,
      been recounted, when the whole drift of the story was clearly foreshadowed
      in the brief talk which immediately took place between him and David as
      they walked townwards across the sands towards their hotel. &ldquo;Daisy,&mdash;for
      though that's not the name your godfathers and godmothers gave you, you're
      such a fresh fellow, that it's the name I best like to call you by&mdash;and
      I wish, I wish, I wish you could give it to me!&rdquo; That of itself had
      its-significance. But still more significant was David's mention of his
      looking in at Steerforth's bed-room on the following morning, before
      himself going away alone, and of his there finding the handsome scapegrace
      fast asleep, &ldquo;lying easily, with his head upon his-arm,&rdquo; as he had often
      seen him lie in the old school dormitory. &ldquo;Thus in this silent hour I left
      him,&rdquo; with mournful tenderness, exclaimed the Reader, in the words and
      accents of his young hero. &ldquo;Never more, O God forgive you, Steerforth! to
      touch that passive hand in love and friendship. Never, never more!&rdquo; The
      revelation of his treachery, towards the pretty little betrothed of the
      young shipwright, followed immediately afterwards, on the occasion of
      David's next visit, some months later, to the old boat on the flats at
      Yarmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonder still is to us, now that we are recalling to mind the salient
      peculiarities of this Reading, as we do so, turning over leaf by leaf the
      marked copy of it, from which the Novelist read; the wonder, we repeat,
      still is to us how, in that exquisite scene, the very words that have
      always moved us most in the novel were struck out in the delivery, are
      rigidly scored through here with blue inkmarks in the reading copy, by the
      hand of the Reader-Novelist. Those words we mean which occur, where Ham,
      having on his arrival, made a movement as if Em'ly were outside, asked
      Mas'r Davy to &ldquo;come out a minute,&rdquo; only for him, on his doing so, to find
      that Em'ly was not there, and that Ham was deadly pale. &ldquo;Ham! what's the
      matter?&rdquo; was gasped out in the Reading. But&mdash;<i>not</i> what follows,
      immediately on that, in the original narrative: &ldquo;'Mas'r Davy!' Oh, for his
      broken heart, how dreadfully he wept!&rdquo; Nor yet the sympathetic
      exclamations of David, who, in the novel, describes himself as paralysed
      by the sight of such grief, not knowing what he thought or what he
      dreaded; only able to look at him,&mdash;yet crying out to him the next
      moment, &ldquo;Ham! Poor, good fellow! For heaven's sake tell me what's the
      matter?&rdquo; Nothing of this: only&mdash;&ldquo;My love, Mas'r Davy&mdash;the pride
      and hope of my 'art, her that I'd have died for, and would die for now&mdash;she's
      gone!&rdquo; &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; &ldquo;Em'ly's run away!&rdquo; Ham, <i>not</i> then adding in the
      Reading, &ldquo;Oh, Mas'r Davy, think <i>how</i> she's run away, when I pray my
      good and gracious God to kill her (her that is so dear above all things)
      sooner than let her come to ruin and disgrace!&rdquo; Yet, for all that, in
      spite of these omissions&mdash;it can hardly by any chance have been
      actually by reason of them&mdash;the delivery of the whole scene was
      singularly powerful and affecting. Especially in the representation of Mr.
      Peggotty's profound grief, under what is to him so appalling a calamity.
      Especially also in the revelation of Mrs. Gummidge's pity for him, her
      gratitude to him, and her womanly tender-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In charming relief to the sequel of this tragic incident of the
      bereavement of the Peggottys, came David's love passages with Dora, and
      his social unbendings with Mr. Micawber. Regaling the latter inimitable
      personage, and his equally inimitable wife, together with David's old
      schoolfellow, Tradelles, on a banquet of boiled leg of mutton, very red
      inside and very pale outside, as well as upon a delusive pigeon-pie, the
      crust of which was like a disappointing phrenological head, &ldquo;full of lumps
      and bumps, with nothing particular underneath,&rdquo; David afforded us the
      opportunity of realising, within a very brief interval, something at least
      of the abundant humour associated with Mrs. Micawber's worldly wisdom, and
      Mr. Micawber's ostentatious impecuniosity. A word, that last, it always
      seems to us&mdash;describing poverty, as it does, with such an air of pomp&mdash;especially
      provided beforehand for Mr. Micawber (out of a prophetic anticipation or
      foreknowledge of him) by the dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere opening of the evening's entertainment at David Copperfield's
      chambers on this occasion, enabled the Humorist to elicit preliminary
      roars of laughter from his audience by his very manner of saying, with a
      deliciously ridiculous prolongation of the liquid consonant forming the
      initial of the last word&mdash;&ldquo;As to Mrs. Micawber, I don't know whether
      it was the effect of the cap, or the lavender water, or the phis, or the
      fire, or the wax-candles, but she came out of my room comparatively
      speaking l-l-lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As deliciously ridiculous was the whole scene between Dora and David,
      where the latter, at length, takes courage to make his proposal&mdash;&ldquo;Jip
      barking madly all the time &ldquo;&mdash;Dora crying the while and trembling.
      David's eloquence increasing, the more he raved, the more Jip barked&mdash;each,
      in his own way, getting more mad every moment! Even when they had got
      married by licence, &ldquo;the Archbishop of Canterbury invoking a blessing, and
      doing it as cheap as it could possibly be expected,&rdquo; their domestic
      experiences were sources of unbounded merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, for example, in connection with their servant girl's cousin in the
      Life Guards, &ldquo;with such long legs that he looked like the afternoon shadow
      of somebody else.&rdquo; Finally, closing the whole of this ingenious epitome of
      the original narrative, came that grand and wonderfully realistic
      description of the stupendous storm upon the beach at Yarmouth, upon the
      extraordinary power of which as a piece of declamation we have already at
      some length commented. There, in the midst of the dying horrors of that
      storm&mdash;there, on those familiar sands, where Mas'r Davy and Little
      Em'ly had so often looked for shells when they were children, on the very
      spot where some lighter fragments of the old boat, blown down the night
      before, had been scattered by the tempest, David Copperfield was heard
      describing, in the last mournful sentence of the Reading, how he saw <i>him</i>
      lying with his curly head upon his arm, as he had often seen him lie when
      they were at school together.

    <h2>
      THE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Fairy Tale of Home was here related, that in its graceful and fantastic
      freaks of fancy might have been imagined by the Danish poet, Hans
      Christian Andersen. In its combination of simple pathos and genial
      drollery, however, it was a story that no other could by possibility have
      told than the great English Humorist. If there was something really akin
      to the genius of Andersen, in the notion of the Cricket with its shrill,
      sharp, piercing voice resounding through the house, and seeming to twinkle
      in the outer darkness like a star, Dickens, and no other could, by any
      chance, have conjured up the forms of either Caleb Plummer, or
      Gruff-and-Tackleton. The cuckoo on the Dutch clock, now like a spectral
      voice, now hiccoughing on the assembled company, as if he had got drunk
      for joy; the little haymaker over the dial mowing down imaginary grass,
      jerking right and left with his scythe in front of a Moorish palace; the
      hideous, hairy, red-eyed jacks-in-boxes; the flies in the Noah's arks,
      that &ldquo;an't on that scale neither as compared with elephants;&rdquo; the giant
      masks, having a certain furtive leer, &ldquo;safe to destroy the peace of mind
      of any young gentlemen between the ages of six and eleven, for the whole
      Christmas or Midsummer vacation,&rdquo; were all of them like dreams of the
      Danish poet, coloured into a semblance of life by the grotesque humour of
      the English Novelist. But dear little Dot, who was rather of the
      dumpling's shape&mdash;&ldquo;but I don't myself object to that&rdquo;&mdash;and good,
      lumbering John Peerybingle, her husband, often so near to something or
      another very clever, according to his own account, and Boxer, the
      carrier's dog, &ldquo;with that preposterous nothing of a fag-end of a tail of
      his, describing circles of barks round the horse, making savage rushes at
      his mistress, and facetiously bringing himself to sudden stops,&rdquo;&mdash;all
      bear upon them unmistakably the sign-manual of Boz.
    </p>
    <p>
      As originally recounted in the Christmas story-book, the whole narrative
      was comprised within a very few pages, portioned out into three little
      chirps. Yet the letter-press was illustrated profusely by pencils as
      eminent as those of Daniel Maclise, of Clarkson Stanfield, of Richard
      Doyle, of John Leech, of Sir Edwin Landseer. The charming little fairy
      tale, moreover, was inscribed to Lord Jeffrey. It was a favourite of his,
      as it still is of many another critic north and south of the Tweed, light,
      nay trivial, though the materials out of which the homely apologue is
      composed. It can hardly be wondered at, however, remembering how less than
      four years prior to its first publication, a literary reviewer, no less
      formidable than Professor Wilson&mdash;while abstaining, in his then
      capacity as chairman of the public banquet given to Charles Dickens at
      Edinburgh, from attempting, as he said, anything like &ldquo;a critical
      delineation of our illustrious guest&rdquo;&mdash;nevertheless, added
      emphatically, &ldquo;I cannot but express in a few ineffectual words the delight
      which every human bosom feels in the benign spirit which pervades all his
      creations.&rdquo; Christopher North thus further expressed his admiration then
      of the young English Novelist&mdash;&ldquo;How kind and good a man he is,&rdquo; the
      great Critic exclaimed, laying aside for a while the crutch with which he
      had so often, in the Ambrosian Nights, brained many an arrant pretender to
      the title of genius or of philanthropist, and turning his lion-like eyes,
      at the moment beaming only with cordiality, on the then youthful face of
      Dickens,&mdash;&ldquo;How kind and good a man he is I need not say, nor what
      strength of genius he has acquired by that profound sympathy with his
      fellow-creatures, whether in prosperity and happiness, or overwhelmed with
      unfortunate circumstances.&rdquo; Purely and simply, in his capacity as an
      imaginative writer, the Novelist had already (then in the June of 1841)
      impressed thus powerfully the heart and judgment of John Wilson, of
      Christopher North, of the inexorable Rhadamanthus of <i>Blackwood</i> and
      the &ldquo;Noctes.&rdquo; Afterwards, but a very little more than two years
      afterwards, came the &ldquo;Carol.&rdquo; The following winter rang out the &ldquo;Chimes.&rdquo;
       The Christmas after that was heard the chirping of the &ldquo;Cricket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four years previously Professor Wilson, on the occasion referred to, had
      remarked of him most truly,&mdash;&ldquo;He has not been deterred by the aspect
      of vice and wickedness, and misery and guilt, from seeking a spirit of
      good in things evil, but has endeavoured by the might of genius to
      transmute what was base into what is precious as the beaten gold;&rdquo;
       observing, indeed, yet further&mdash;&ldquo;He has mingled in the common walks
      of life; he has made himself familiar with the lower orders of society.&rdquo;
       As if in supplementary and conclusive justification of those words,
      Dickens, within less than five years afterwards, had woven his graceful
      and pathetic fancies about the homely joys and sorrows of Bob Cratchit, of
      Toby Veck, and of Caleb Plummer, of a little Clerk, a little
      Ticket-porter, and a little Toy-maker. His pen at these times was like the
      wand of Cinderella's fairy godmother, changing the cucumber into a gilded
      chariot, and the lizards into glittering retainers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the commencement of this Reading but very little indeed was said about
      the Cricket, hardly anything at all about the kettle. Yet, as everybody
      knows, &ldquo;the kettle began it&rdquo; in the story-book. The same right of
      precedence was accorded to the kettle in the author's delivery of his
      fairy tale by word of mouth, but otherwise its comfortable purring song
      was in a manner hushed. One heard nothing about its first appearance on
      the hearth, when &ldquo;it would lean forward with a drunken air, and dribble, a
      very idiot of a kettle,&rdquo; any more than of its final pæan, when, after its
      iron body hummed and stirred upon the fire, the lid itself, the recently
      rebellious lid, performed a sort of jig, and clattered &ldquo;like a deaf and
      dumb young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother.&rdquo; Here,
      again, in fact, as with so many other of these Readings from his own books
      by our Novelist, the countless good things scattered abundantly up and
      down the original descriptions&mdash;inimitable touches of humour that had
      each of them, on the appreciative palate, the effect of that verbal
      bon-bon, the bon-mot&mdash;were sacrificed inexorably, apparently without
      a qualm, and certainly by wholesale. What the Reader looked to throughout,
      was the human element in his imaginings when they were to be impersonated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let but one of these tid-bits be associated directly with the fanciful
      beings introduced in the gradual unfolding of the incidents, and it might
      remain there untouched, Thus, for example, when the Carrier's arrival at
      his home came to be mentioned, and the Reader related how John
      Peerybingle, being much taller, as well as much older than his wife,
      little Dot, &ldquo;had to stoop a long way down to kiss her&rdquo;&mdash;the words
      that followed thereupon were happily <i>not</i> omitted: &ldquo;but she was
      worth the trouble,&mdash;six foot six with the lumbago might have done
      it.&rdquo; Several of John's choicest&mdash;all-but jokes were also retained.
      As, where Dot is objecting to be called by that pet diminutive, &ldquo;'Why,
      what else are you?' returned John, looking down upon her with a smile, and
      giving her waist as light a squeeze as his huge hand and arm could give,
      'A dot and'&mdash;here he glanced at the baby&mdash;'a dot and carry'&mdash;I
      won't say it, for fear I should spoil it; but I was very near a joke. I
      don't know as ever I was nearer.&rdquo; Tilly Slowboy and her charge, the baby,
      were, upon every mention of them in the Reading, provocative of abundant
      laughter. The earliest allusion to Miss Slowboy recording these
      characteristic circumstances in regard to her costume, that it &ldquo;was
      remarkable for the partial development, on all possible and impossible
      occasions, of some flannel vestment of a singular structure, also for
      affording glimpses in the region of the back of a pair of stays, in colour
      a dead green.&rdquo; On the introduction of the Mysterious Stranger&mdash;apparently
      all but stone deaf&mdash;from the Carrier's cart, where he had been
      forgotten, the comic influence of the Reading became irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stranger (on noticing Dot) interrogatively to John.&mdash;&ldquo;Your Daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrier, with the voice of a boatswain.&mdash;&ldquo;Wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stranger, with his hand to his ear, being not quite certain that he has
      caught it.&mdash;&ldquo;Niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrier, with a roar.&mdash;&ldquo;Wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied at last upon that point, the stranger asks of John, as a new
      matter of curiosity to him, &ldquo;Baby, yours?&rdquo; Whereupon the Reader, <i>as</i>
      John, &ldquo;gave a gigantic nod, equivalent to an answer in the affirmative,
      delivered through a speaking-trumpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stranger, still unsatisfied, inquiring,&mdash;&ldquo;Girl?&rdquo;.&mdash;&ldquo;Bo-o-oy!&rdquo;
       was bellowed back by John Peerybingle. It was when Mrs. Peerybingle
      herself took up the parable, however, that the merriment excited among the
      audience became fairly irrepressible. Scarcely had the nearly stone-deaf
      stranger added, in regard to the &ldquo;Bo-o-oy,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Also very young, eh?&rdquo;
       (a comment previously applied by him to Dot) when the Reader, as Mrs.
      Peerybingle, instantly struck in, at the highest pitch of his voice, that
      is, of her voice (the comic effect of this being simply indescribable)&mdash;&ldquo;Two
      months and three da-ays! Vaccinated six weeks ago-o! Took very fine-ly!
      Considered, by the doctor, a remarkably beautiful chi-ild! Equal to the
      general run of children at five months o-old! Takes notice in a way quite
      won-der-ful! May seem impossible to you, but feels his feet al-ready!&rdquo;
       Directly afterwards, Caleb Plummer appeared upon the scene, little
      imagining that in the Mysterious-Stranger would be discovered, later on,
      under the disguise of that nearly stone-deaf old gentleman, his (Caleb's)
      own dear boy, Edward, supposed to have died in the golden South Americas.
      Little Caleb's inquiry of Mrs. Peerybingle,&mdash;&ldquo;You couldn't have the
      goodness to let me pinch Boxer's tail, Mum, for half a moment, could you?&rdquo;
       was one of the welcome whimsicalities of the Reading. &ldquo;Why, Caleb! what a
      question!&rdquo; naturally enough was Dot's instant exclamation. &ldquo;Oh, never
      mind, Mum!&rdquo; said the little toy-maker, apologetically, &ldquo;He mightn't like
      it perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;adding, by way of explanation&mdash;&ldquo;There's a small
      order just come in, for barking dogs; and I should wish to go as close to
      Natur' as I could, for sixpence!&rdquo; Caleb's employer, Tackleton, in his
      large green cape and bull-headed looking mahogany tops, was then described
      as entering pretty much in the manner of what one might suppose to be that
      of an ogrish toy-merchant. His character came out best perhaps&mdash;meaning,
      in another sense, that is, at its worst&mdash;when the fairy spirit of
      John's house, the Cricket, was heard chirping; and Tackleton asked,
      grumpily,&mdash;&ldquo;Why don't you kill that cricket? I would! I always do! I
      hate their noise!&rdquo; John exclaiming, in amazement,&mdash;&ldquo;You kill your
      crickets, eh?&rdquo; &ldquo;Scrunch 'em, sir!&rdquo; quoth Tackleton. One of the most
      wistfully curious thoughts uttered in the whole of the Reading was the
      allusion to the original founder of the toy-shop of Gruff and Tackleton,
      where it was remarked (such a quaint epitome of human life!) that under
      that same crazy roof, beneath which Caleb Plummer and Bertha, his blind
      daughter, found shelter as their humble home,&mdash;&ldquo;the Gruff before last
      had, in a small way, <i>made toys for a generation of old boys and girls,
      who had played with them, and found them out, and broken them, and gone to
      sleep</i>.&rdquo; Another wonderfully comic minor character was introduced later
      on in the eminently ridiculous person of old Mrs. Fielding&mdash;in regard
      to in-door gloves, a foreshadowing of Mrs. Wilfer&mdash;in the matter of
      her imaginary losses through the indigo trade, a spectral precursor, or
      dim prototype, as one might say, of Mrs. Pipchin and the Peruvian mines.
      Throughout the chief part of the dreamy, dramatic little story, the
      various characters, it will be remembered, are involved in a mazy
      entanglement of cross purposes. Mystery sometimes, pathos often, terror
      for one brief interval, rose from the Reading of the &ldquo;Home Fairy-Tale.&rdquo;
       There was a subdued tenderness which there was no resisting in the
      revelation to the blind girl, Bertha, of the illusions in which she had
      been lapped for years by her sorcerer of a lather, poor little Caleb, the
      toy-maker. There was at once a tearful and a laughing earnestness that
      took the Reader's audience captive, not by any means unwillingly, when
      little Dot was, at the last, represented as &ldquo;clearing it all up at home&rdquo;
       (indirectly, to the great honour of the Cricket's reputation, by the way)
      to her burly husband&mdash;good, stupid, worthy, &ldquo;clumsy man in general,&rdquo;&mdash;John
      Peerybingle, the Carrier. The one inconsistent person in the whole story,
      it must be admitted, was Tackleton, who turned out at the very end to be
      rather a good fellow than otherwise. Fittingly enough, in the Reading as
      in the book, when the &ldquo;Fairy Tale of Home&rdquo; was related to its close, when
      Dot and all the rest were spoken of as vanished, a broken child's-toy, we
      were told, yet lay upon the ground, and still upon the hearth was heard
      the song of the Cricket.

    <h2>
      NICHOLAS NICKLEBY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A variety of attractive Readings might readily have been culled from
      Nicholas Nickleby's Life and Adventures. His comical experiences as a
      strolling-player in the Company of the immortal Crummleses&mdash;his
      desperate encounter with Sir Mulberry Hawk on the footboard of the
      cabriolet&mdash;his exciting rescue of Madeline from an unholy alliance
      with Gride, the miser, on the very morning fixed for the revolting
      marriage&mdash;his grotesque association for a while with the Kenwigses
      and their uncle Lilliyick&mdash;his cordial relations with the Brothers
      Cheeryble and old Tim Linkinwater&mdash;any one of these incidents in the
      career of the most high spirited of all the young heroes of our Novelist,
      would have far more than simply justified its selection as the theme of
      one of these illustrative entertainments. Instead of choosing any one of
      those later episodes in the fictitious history of Nicholas Nickleby,
      however, the author of that enthralling romance of everyday life, picked
      out, by preference, the earliest of all his young hero's experiences&mdash;those
      in which, at nineteen years of age, he was brought into temporary
      entanglement with the domestic economy of Dotheboys Hall, and at the last
      into personal conflict with its one-eyed principal, the rascally Yorkshire
      school-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadshill collection of thin octavos, comprising the whole series of
      Readings, includes within it two copies of &ldquo;Mrs. Gamp&rdquo; and two copies of
      &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby.&rdquo; Whereas, on comparing the duplicates of Mrs. Gamp,
      the two versions appear to be so slightly different that they are all but
      identical, a marked contrast is observable at a glance between the two
      Nicklebys. Each Reading is descriptive, it is true, of his sayings and
      doings at the Yorkshire school. But, even externally, one of the two
      copies is marked &ldquo;Short Time,&rdquo;&mdash;the love-passages with Miss Squeers
      bemg entirely struck out, and no mention whatever being made of John
      Browdie, the corn-factor. The wretched school, the sordid rascal who keeps
      it, Mrs. Squeers, poor, forlorn Smike, and a few of his scarecrow
      companions&mdash;these, in the short-time version, and these alone,
      constitute the young usher's surroundings. In here recalling to
      recollection the &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo; Reading at all, however, we select,
      as a matter of course, the completer version, the one for which the
      generality of hearers had an evident preference: the abbreviated version
      being always regarded as capital, so far as it went; but even at the best,
      with all the go and dash of its rapid delivery, insufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything, even, we should imagine, to one un-acquainted with the novel,
      was ingeniously explained by the Reader in a sentence or two at starting.
      Nicholas Nickleby was described as arriving early one November morning, at
      the Saracen's Head, to join, in his new capacity (stripling though he was)
      as scholastic assistant, Mr. Squeers, &ldquo;the cheap&mdash;the terribly cheap&rdquo;
       Yorkshire schoolmaster. The words just given in inverted commas are those
      written in blue ink in the Novelist's handwriting on the margin of his
      longer Reading copy. As also are the following words, epitomising in a
      breath the position of the young hero when the story commences&mdash;&ldquo;Inexperienced,
      sanguine, and thrown upon the world with no adviser, and his bread to
      win,&rdquo; the manuscript interpolation thus intimates: the letterpress then
      relating in its integrity that Nicholas had engaged himself as tutor at
      Mr. Wackford Squeers's academy, on the strength of the memorable
      advertisement in the London newspapers. The advertisement, that is,
      comprising within it the long series of accomplishments imparted to the
      students at Dotheboys Hall, including &ldquo;single-stick&rdquo; (if required),
      together with &ldquo;fortification, and every other branch of classical
      literature.&rdquo; The Reader laying particular stress, among other items in the
      announcement, upon &ldquo;No extras, no vacations, and diet unparalleled;&rdquo; and
      upon the finishing touch (having especial reference to the subject in
      hand), &ldquo;An able assistant wanted: annual salary, £5! A master of arts
      would be preferred!&rdquo; Immediately after this, in the Reading, came the
      description of Mr. Squeers, several of the particulars in regard to whose
      villainous appearance always told wonderfully: as, where it was said &ldquo;he
      had but one eye, and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two;&rdquo; or,
      again, where in reference to his attire&mdash;it having been mentioned
      that his coat-sleeves were a great deal too-long and his trousers a great
      deal too short&mdash;it was added that &ldquo;he appeared ill at ease in his
      clothes, and as if he were in a perpetual state of astonishment at finding
      himself so respectable.&rdquo; Listening to the Reader, we were there, in the
      coffee-room of the Saracen's Head&mdash;the rascal Squeers in the full
      enjoyment of his repast of hot toast and cold round of beef, the while
      five little boys sat opposite hungrily and thirstily expectant of their
      share in a miserable meal of two-penn'orth of milk and thick bread and
      butter for three. &ldquo;Just fill that mug up with lukewarm water, William,
      will you?&rdquo; &ldquo;To the wery top, sir? Why the milk will be drownded!&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Serve
      it right for being so dear!</i>&rdquo; Squeers adding with a chuckle, as he
      pounded away at his own coffee and viands,&mdash;&ldquo;Conquer your passions,
      boys, and don't be eager after wittles.&rdquo; To see the Reader as Squeers,
      stirring the mug of lukewarm milk and water, and then smacking his lips
      with an affected relish after tasting a spoonful of it, before reverting
      to his own fare of buttered toast and beef, was to be there with Nicholas,
      a spectator on that wintry morning in the Snow Hill Tavern, watching the
      guttling pedagogue and the five little famished expectants. Only when
      Squeers, immediately before the signal for the coach starting, wiped his
      mouth, with a self-satisfied &ldquo;Thank God for a good breakfast,&rdquo; was the mug
      rapidly passed from mouth to mouth at once ravenously and tantalizingly.
      The long and bitter journey on the north road, through the snow, was
      barely referred to in the Reading; due mention, however, being made, and
      always tellingly, of Mr. S queers's habit of getting down at nearly every
      stage&mdash;&ldquo;to stretch his legs, he said,&mdash;and as he always came
      back with a very red nose, and composed himself to sleep directly, the
      stretching seemed to answer.&rdquo; Immediately on the wayfarers' arrival at
      Dotheboys, Mrs. Squeers, arrayed in a dimity night-jacket, herself a head
      taller than Mr. Squeers, was always introduced with great effect, as
      seizing her Squeery by the throat and giving him two loud kisses in rapid
      succession, like a postman's knock. The audience then scarcely had time to
      laugh over the interchange of questions and answers between the happy
      couple, as to the condition of the cows and pigs, and, last of all, the
      boys, ending with Madame's intimation that &ldquo;young Pitcher's had a fever,&rdquo;
       followed up by Squeers's characteristic exclamation, &ldquo;No! damn that chap,
      he's always at something of that sort&rdquo;&mdash;when there came the first
      glimpse of poor Smike, in a skeleton suit, and large boots originally made
      for tops, too patched and ragged now for a beggar; around his throat &ldquo;a
      tattered child's frill only half concealed by a coarse man's neckerchief.&rdquo;
       Anxiously observing Squeers, as he emptied his overcoat of letters and
      papers, the boy did this, we were told, with an air so dispirited and
      hopeless, that Nicholas could hardly bear to watch him. &ldquo;Have you&mdash;did
      anybody&mdash;has nothing been heard&mdash;about me?&rdquo; were then (in the
      faintest, frightened voice!) the first stammered utterances of the
      wretched drudge. Bullied into silence by the brutal schoolmaster, Smike
      limped away with a vacant smile, when we heard the female scoundrel in the
      dimity night-jacket saying,&mdash;&ldquo;I'll tell you what, Squeers, I think
      that young chap's turning silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inducted into the loathsome school-room on the following morning by
      Squeers himself, Nicholas, first of all, we were informed, witnessed the
      manner in which that arrant rogue presided over &ldquo;the first class in
      English spelling and philosophy,&rdquo; practically illustrating his mode of
      tuition by setting the scholars to clean the w-i-n win, d-e-r-s ders,
      winders&mdash;to weed the garden&mdash;to rub down the horse, or get
      rubbed down themselves if they didn't do it well. Nicholas assisted in the
      afternoon, moreover, at the report given by Mr. Squeers on his return
      homewards after his half-yearly visit to the metropolis. Beginning, though
      this last-mentioned part of the Reading did, with Squeers's ferocious
      slash on the desk with his cane, and his announcement, in the midst of a
      death-like silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let any boy speak a word without leave, and I'll take the skin off that
      boy's back!&rdquo; many of the particulars given immediately afterwards by the
      Reader were, in spite of the surrounding misery, irresistibly provocative
      of laughter. Ample justification for this, in truth, is very readily
      adduceable. Mr. Squeers having, through his one eye, made a mental
      abstract of Cobbey's letter, for example, Cobbey and the whole school were
      thus feelingly informed of its contents&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Cobbey's grandmother is
      dead, and his uncle John has took to drinking. Which is all the news his
      sister sends, except eighteen-pence&mdash;which will just pay for that
      broken square of glass! Mrs. Squeers, my dear, will you take the money?&rdquo;
       Another while, Graymarsh's maternal aunt, who &ldquo;thinks Mrs. Squeers must be
      a angel,&rdquo; and that Mr. Squeers is too good for this world, &ldquo;would have
      sent the two pairs of stockings, as desired, but is short of money, so
      forwards a tract instead,&rdquo; and so on; &ldquo;Ah-! a delightful letter&mdash;very
      affecting, indeed!&rdquo; quoth Squeers. &ldquo;It was affecting in one sense!&rdquo;
       observed the Reader; &ldquo;for Graymarsh's maternal aunt was strongly supposed
      by her more intimate friends to be his maternal parent!&rdquo; Perhaps the
      epistle from Mobbs's mother-in-law was the best of all, however&mdash;the
      old lady who &ldquo;took to her bed on hearing that he wouldn't eat fat;&rdquo; and
      who &ldquo;wishes to know by an early post where he expects to go to, if he
      quarrels with his vittles?&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;This was told her in the London
      newspapers&mdash;not by Mr. Squeers, for he is too kind and too good to
      set anybody against anybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As an interlude, overflowing with fun, came Miss Squeers's tea-drinking&mdash;the
      result of her suddenly falling in love with the new usher, and that
      chiefly by reason of the straightness of his legs, &ldquo;the general run of
      legs at Dotheboys Hall being crooked.&rdquo; How John Browdie (with his hair
      damp from washing) appeared upon the occasion in a clean shirt&mdash;&ldquo;whereof
      thecollars might have belonged to some giant ancestor,&rdquo;&mdash;and greeted
      the assembled company, including his intended, Tilda Price, &ldquo;with a grin
      that even the collars could not conceal,&rdquo; the creator of the worthy
      Yorkshireman went on to describe, with a gusto akin to the relish with
      which every utterance of John Browdie's was caught up by the listeners.
      Whether he spoke in good humour or in ill humour, the burly cornfactor was
      equally delightful. One while saying, laughingly, to Nicholas, across the
      bread-and-butter plate which they had just been emptying between them, &ldquo;Ye
      wean't get bread-and-butther ev'ry neight, I expect, mun. Ecod, they
      dean't put too much intif 'em. Ye'll be nowt but skeen and boans if you
      stop here long eneaf. Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;&mdash;all this to Nicholas's
      unspeakable indignation. Or, another while, after chafing in jealousy for
      a long time over the coquetries going on between Tilda Price and Nicholas&mdash;the
      Yorkshireman flattening his own nose with his clenched fist again and
      again, &ldquo;as if to keep his hand in till he had an opportunity of exercising
      it on the nose of some other gentleman,&rdquo;&mdash;until asked merrily by his
      betrothed to keep his glum silence no longer, but to say something: &ldquo;Say
      summat?&rdquo; roared John Browdie, with a mighty blow on the table; &ldquo;Weal,
      then! what I say 's this&mdash;Dang my boans and boddy, if I stan' this
      ony longer! Do ye gang whoam wi' me; and do yon loight and toight young
      whipster look sharp out for a brokken head next time he cums under my
      hond. Cum whoam, tell'e, cum whoam!&rdquo; After Smike's running away, and his
      being brought back again, had been rapidly recounted, what nearly every
      individual member of every audience in attendance at this Reading was
      eagerly on the watch for all along, at last, in the fullness of time,
      arrived,&mdash;the execrable Squeers receiving, instead of administering,
      a frightful beating, in the presence of the whole school; having carefully
      provided himself beforehand, as all were rejoiced to remember, with &ldquo;a
      fearful instrument of flagellation, strong, supple, wax-ended, and new!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So real are the characters described by Charles Dickens in his life-like
      fictions, and so exactly do the incidents he relates as having befallen
      them resemble actual occurrences, that we recall to recollection at this
      moment the delight with which the late accomplished Lady Napier once
      related an exact case in point, appealing, as she did so, to her husband,
      the author of the &ldquo;Peninsular War,&rdquo; to corroborate the-accuracy of her
      retrospect! Telling how she perfectly well remembered, when the fourth
      green number of &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo; was just out, one of her home group,
      who had a moment before caught sight of the picture of the flogging in a
      shop-window, rushed in with the startling announcement&mdash;as though he
      were bringing with him the news of some great victory&mdash;&ldquo;What do you
      think? <i>Nicholas has thrashed Squeers!</i>&rdquo; As the Novelist read this
      chapter, or rather the condensation of this chapter, it was for all the
      world like assisting in person at that sacred and refreshing rite!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is every boy here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, every boy was there, and so was every observant listener, in eager
      and&mdash;knowing what was coming&mdash;in delighted expectation. As
      Squeers was represented as &ldquo;glaring along the lines,&rdquo; to assure himself
      that every boy really <i>was</i> there, what time &ldquo;every eye drooped and
      every head cowered down,&rdquo; the Reader, instead of uttering one word of what
      the ruffianly schoolmaster ought then to have added: &ldquo;Each boy keep to his
      place. Nickleby! you go to your desk, sir!&rdquo;&mdash;instead of saying one
      syllable of this, contented himself with obeying his own manuscript
      marginal direction, in one word&mdash;Pointing! The effect of this simple
      gesture was startling&mdash;particularly when, after the momentary hush
      with which it was always accompanied, he observed quietly,&mdash;&ldquo;There
      was a curious expression in the usher's face, but he took his seat without
      opening his lips in reply.&rdquo; Then, when the schoolmaster had dragged in the
      wretched Smike by the collar, &ldquo;or rather by that fragment of his jacket
      which was nearest the place where his collar ought to have been,&rdquo; there
      was a horrible relish in his saying, over his shoulder for a moment,
      &ldquo;Stand a little out of the way, Mrs. Squeers, my dear; <i>I've hardly got
      room enough!</i>&rdquo; The instant one cruel blow had fallen&mdash;&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; was
      cried in a voice that made the rafters ring&mdash;even the lofty rafters
      of St. James's Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squeers, with the glare and snarl of a wild beast.&mdash;&ldquo;Who cried stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas.&mdash;&ldquo;I did! This must not go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Squeers, again, with a frightful look.&mdash;&ldquo;Must not go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas.&mdash;&ldquo;Must not! Shall not! I will prevent it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came Nicholas Nickleby's manly denunciation of the scoundrel,
      interrupted one while for an instant by Squeers screaming out, &ldquo;Sit down,
      you&mdash;beggar!&rdquo; and followed at its close by the last and crowning
      outrage, consequent on a violent outbreak of wrath on the part of Squeers,
      who spat at him and struck him a blow across the face with his instrument
      of torture: when Nicholas, springing upon him, wrested the weapon from his
      hand, and pinning him by the throat&mdash;don't we all exult in the
      remembrance of it?&mdash;&ldquo;beat the ruffian till he roared for mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that climax has been attained, two other particulars are alone
      worthy of being recalled to recollection in regard to this Reading. First,
      the indescribable heartiness of John Browdie's cordial shake-of-the-hand
      with Nicholas Nickleby on their encountering each other by accident upon
      the high road. &ldquo;Shake honds? Ah! that I weel!&rdquo; coupled with his ecstatic
      shout (so ecstatic that his horse shyed at it), &ldquo;Beatten schoolmeasther!
      Ho! ho! ho! Beatten schoolmeasther! Who ever heard o' the loike o' that,
      noo? Give us thee hond agean, yoongster! Beatten schoolmeasther! Dang it,
      I loove thee for 't!&rdquo; Finally, and as the perfecting touch of tenderness
      between the two cousins, then unknown to each other as such, in the early
      morning light at Boroughbridge, we caught a glimpse of Nicholas and Smike
      passing, hand in hand, out of the old barn together.

    <h2>
      MR. BOB SAWYER'S PARTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Quite as exhilarating in its way as the all-but dramatised report of the
      great breach of promise case tried before Mr. Justice Stareleigh, was that
      other condensation of a chapter from &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; descriptive of Mr. Bob
      Sawyer's Party. It was a Reading, in the delivery of which the Reader
      himself had evidently the keenest sense of enjoyment. As a humorous
      description, it was effervescent with fun, being written throughout in the
      happiest, earliest style of the youthful genius of Boz, when the green
      numbers were first shaking the sides of lettered and unlettered Englishmen
      alike with Homeric laughter. Besides this, when given by him as a Reading,
      it comprised within it one of his very drollest impersonations. If only as
      the means of introducing us to Jack Hopkins, it would have been most
      acceptable. But, inimitable though Jack was, he was, at the least,
      thoroughly well companioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a relish of what was coming, there was that preliminary account of the
      locality in which the festivities were held, to wit, Lant Street, in the
      borough of Southwark, the prevailing repose of which, we were told, &ldquo;sheds
      a gentle melancholy upon the soul&rdquo;&mdash;fully justifying its selection as
      a haven of rest by any one who wished &ldquo;to abstract himself from the world,
      to remove himself from the reach of temptation, to place himself beyond
      the possibility of any inducement to look out of window!&rdquo; As specimens of
      animated nature, familiarly met with in the neighbourhood, &ldquo;the pot-boy,
      the muffin youth, and the baked potato man,&rdquo; had about them a perennial
      freshness. Whenever we were reminded, again, in regard to the principal
      characteristics of the population that it was migratory, &ldquo;usually
      disappearing on the verge of quarter-day, and generally by night,&rdquo; her
      Majesty's revenues being seldom collected in that happy valley, its rents
      being pronounced dubious, and its water communication described as
      &ldquo;frequently cut off,&rdquo; we found in respect to the whole picture thus
      lightly-sketched in, that age did not wither nor custom stale its infinite
      comicality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when the familiar personages of the story were, one after another,
      introduced upon the scene, however, that the broad Pickwickian humour of
      it all began in earnest to be realised. After we had listened with
      chuckling enjoyment to the ludicrously minute account given of the
      elaborate preparations made for the reception of the visitors, even in the
      approaches to Mr. Bob Sawyer's apartment, down to the mention of the
      kitchen candle with a long snuff, that &ldquo;burnt cheerfully on the ledge of
      the staircase window,&rdquo; we had graphically rendered the memorable scene
      between poor, dejected Bob and his little spitfire of a landlady, Mrs.
      Raddle. <i>So</i> dejected and generally suppressed was Bob in the
      Reading, however, that we should hardly have recognised that very
      archetype of the whole <i>genus</i> of rollicking Medical Students, as
      originally described in the pages of Pickwick, where he is depicted as
      attired in &ldquo;a coarse blue coat, which, without being either a great-coat
      or a surtout, partook of the nature and qualities of both,&rdquo; having about
      him that sort of slovenly smartness and swaggering gait peculiar to young
      gentlemen who smoke in the streets by day, and shout and scream in the
      same by night, calling waiters by their Christian names, and altogether
      bearing a resemblance upon the whole to something like a dissipated
      Robinson Crusoe. Habited, Bob still doubtless was, in the plaid trousers
      and the large, rough coat and double-breasted waistcoat, but as for the
      &ldquo;swaggering gait&rdquo; just mentioned not a vestige of it remained. Nor could
      that be wondered at, indeed, for an instant, beholding and hearing, as we
      did, the shrill ferocity with which Mrs. Raddle had it out with him about
      the rent immediately before the arrival of his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the distinctive peculiarities of Charles Dickens as a
      humorous Novelist, that the cream or quintessence of a jest is very often
      given by him quite casually in a parenthesis. It was equally distinctive
      of his peculiarities as a Reader, that the especial charm of his drollery
      was often conveyed by the merest aside. Thus it was with him in reference
      to Mrs. Raddle's &ldquo;confounded little bill,&rdquo; when&mdash;in between Ben
      Allen's inquiry, &ldquo;How long has it been running?&rdquo; and Bob Sawyer's reply,
      &ldquo;Only about a quarter and a month or so&rdquo;&mdash;the Reader parenthetically
      remarked, with a philosophic air, &ldquo;A bill, by the way, is the most
      extraordinary locomotive engine that the genius of man ever produced: it
      would keep on running during the longest lifetime without ever once
      stopping of its own accord.&rdquo; Thus also was it, when he added meditatively
      to Bob's hesitating explanation to Mrs. Raddle, &ldquo;the fact is that I have
      been disappointed in the City to-day&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Extraordinary place that
      City: astonishing number of men always <i>are</i> getting disappointed
      there.&rdquo; Hereupon it was that that fiercest of little women, Mrs. Raddle,
      who had entered &ldquo;in a tremble with passion and pale with rage,&rdquo; fairly let
      out at her lodger. Her incidental bout with Mr. Ben Allen, when he
      soothingly(!) interpolated, &ldquo;My good soul,&rdquo; was, in the Reading, in two
      senses, a memorable diversion. Beginning with a sarcastic quivering in her
      voice, &ldquo;I am not <i>aweer</i>, sir, that you have any right to address
      your conversation to <i>me</i>. I don't think I let these apartments to <i>you</i>,
      sir&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Raddle's anger rose through an indignant <i>crescendo</i>,
      on Ben Allen's remonstrating, &ldquo;But you are such an unreasonable woman&rdquo;&mdash;to
      the sharp and biting interrogation, &ldquo;I beg your parding, young man, but
      will you have the goodness to call me that again, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben Allen, meekly and somewhat uneasy on his own account,&mdash;&ldquo;I didn't
      make use of the word in any invidious sense, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Landlady, louder and more imperatively,&mdash;&ldquo;I beg your parding, young
      man, but <i>who</i> do you call a woman? Did you make that remark to me,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why, bless my heart!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you apply that name to me, I ask of you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his answering, Well, of course he did!&mdash;then, as she retreated
      towards the open room-door, came the last outburst of her invectives,
      high-pitched in their voluble utterance, against him, against them both,
      against everybody, including Mr. Raddle in the kitchen&mdash;&ldquo;a base,
      faint-hearted, timorous wretch, that's afraid to come upstairs and face
      the ruffinly creaturs&mdash;that's <i>afraid</i> to come&mdash;that's
      afraid!&rdquo; Ending with her screaming descent of the stairs in the midst of a
      loud double-knock, upon the arrival just then of the Pickwickians, when,
      &ldquo;in an uncontrollable burst of mental agony,&rdquo; Mrs. Raddle threw down all
      the umbrellas in the passage, disappearing into the back parlour with an
      awful crash. In answer to the cheerful inquiry from Mr. Pickwick,&mdash;&ldquo;Does
      Mr. Sawyer live here?&rdquo; came the lugubrious and monotonously intoned
      response, all on one note, of the aboriginal young person, the gal Betsey
      (one of the minor characters in the original chapter, and yet, as already
      remarked, a superlatively good impersonation in the Reading)&mdash;&ldquo;Yes;
      first-floor. It's the door straight afore you when you get's to the top of
      the stairs&rdquo;&mdash;with which the dirty slipshod in black cotton stockings
      disappeared with the candle down the kitchen stair-case, leaving the
      unfortunate arrivals to grope their way up as they best could. Welcomed
      rather dejectedly by Bob on the first-floor landing, where Mr. Pickwick
      put, not, as in the original work, his hat, but, in the Reading, &ldquo;his
      foot&rdquo; in the tray of glasses, they were very soon followed, one after
      another, by the remainder of the visitors. Notably by a sentimental young
      gentleman with a nice sense of honour, and, most notably of all (with a
      heavy footstep, very welcome indeed whenever heard) by Jack Hopkins. Jack
      was at once the Hamlet and the Yorick of the whole entertainment&mdash;all-essential
      to it&mdash;whose very look (with his chin rather stiff in the stock),
      whose very words (short, sharp, and decisive) had about them a drily and
      all-but indescribably humorous effect. As spoken by the Novelist himself,
      Jack Hopkins's every syllable told to perfection. His opening report
      immediately on his arrival, of &ldquo;rather a good accident&rdquo; just brought into
      the casualty ward&mdash;only, it was true, a man fallen out of a
      four-pair-of-stairs window; but a very fair case, <i>very</i> fair case
      indeed!&mdash;was of itself a dexterous forefinger between the small ribs
      to begin with. Would the patient recover? Well, no&mdash;with an air of
      supreme indifference&mdash;no, he should rather say he wouldn't. But there
      must be a splendid operation, though, on the morrow&mdash;magnificent
      sight if Slasher did it! Did he consider Mr. Slasher a good operator?
      &ldquo;Best alive: took a boy's leg out of the socket last week&mdash;boy ate
      five apples and a gingerbread cake exactly two minutes after it was all
      over;&mdash;boy said he wouldn't lie there to be made game of; and he'd
      tell his mother if they didn't begin.&rdquo; To hear Dickens say this in the
      short, sharp utterances of Jack Hopkins, to see his manner in recounting
      it, stiff-necked, and with a glance under the drooping eyelids in the
      direction of Mr. Pickwick's listening face, was only the next best thing
      to hearing him and seeing him, still in the person of Jack Hopkins, relate
      the memorable anecdote about the child swallowing the necklace&mdash;pronounced
      in Jack Hopkins's abbreviated articulation of it, <i>neck-luss</i>&mdash;a
      word repeated by him a round dozen times at the least within a few seconds
      in the reading version of that same anecdote. How characteristically and
      comically the abbreviations were multiplied for the delivery of it, by the
      very voice and in the very person, as it were, of Jack Hopkins, who shall
      say! As, for example&mdash;&ldquo;Sister, industrious girl, seldom treated
      herself to bit of finery, cried eyes out, at loss of&mdash;neck-luss;
      looked high and low for&mdash;neck-luss. Few days afterwards, family at
      dinner&mdash;baked, shoulder of mutton and potatoes, child wasn't hungry,
      playing about the room, when family suddenly heard devil of a noise like
      small hail-storm.&rdquo; How abbreviated passages like these look, as compared
      with the original&mdash;could only be rendered comprehensible upon the
      instant, by giving in this place a facsimile of one of the pages relating
      to Jack Hopkins's immortal story about the&mdash;neck-luss, exactly as it
      appears in the marked copy of the Reading of &ldquo;Mr. Bob Sawyer's Party,&rdquo; a
      page covered all over, as will be observed, with minute touches in the
      Novelist's own handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing at all in the later version of this Reading was said about the
      prim person in cloth boots, who unsuccessfully attempted all through the
      evening to make a joke. Of him the readers of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; will very well
      remember it to have been related that he commenced a long story about a
      great public character, whose name he had forgotten, making a particularly
      happy reply to another illustrious individual whom he had never been able
      to identify, and, after enlarging with great minuteness upon divers
      collateral circumstances distantly connected with the anecdote, could not
      for the life of him recollect at that precise moment what the anecdote was&mdash;although
      he had been in the habit, for the last ten years, of telling the story
      with great applause! While disposed to regret the omission of this
      preposterously natural incident from the revised version of the Reading,
      and especially Bob Sawyer's concluding remark in regard to it, that he
      should very much like to hear the end of it, for, <i>so far as it went</i>,
      it was, without exception, the very best story he had ever heard&mdash;we
      were more than compensated by another revisive touch, by which Mr.
      Hopkins, instead of Mr. Gunter, in the pink shirt, was represented as one
      of the two interlocutors in the famous quarrel-scene: the other being Mr.
      Noddy, the scorbutic youth, with the nice sense of honour. Through this
      modification the ludicrous effect of the squabble was wonderfully
      enhanced, as where Mr. Noddy, having been threatened with being &ldquo;pitched
      out o' window&rdquo; by Mr. Jack Hopkins, said to the latter, &ldquo;I should like to
      see you do it, sir,&rdquo; Jack Hopkins curtly retaliating&mdash;&ldquo;You shall <i>feel</i>
      me do it, sir, in half a minute.&rdquo; The reconciliation of the two attained
      its climax of absurdity in the Reading, when Mr. Noddy, having gradually
      allowed his feelings to overpower him, professed that he had ever
      entertained a devoted personal attachment to Mr. Hopkins. Consequent upon
      this, Mr. Hopkins, we were told, replied, that, &ldquo;on the whole, he rather
      preferred Mr. Noddy to his own <i>mother</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the word standing, of
      course, as &ldquo;brother&rdquo; in the original. Summing it all up, the Reader would
      then add, with a rise and fall of the voice at almost every other word in
      the sentence, the mere sound of which was inexpressibly ludicrous&mdash;&ldquo;Everybody
      said the whole dispute had been conducted in a manner&rdquo; (here he would
      sometimes gag) &ldquo;that did equal credit to the head and heart of both
      parties concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another gag, of which there is no sign in the marked copy, those who
      attended any later delivery of this Reading will well remember he was fond
      of introducing. This was immediately after Mrs. Raddle had put an end to
      the evening's enjoyment in the very middle of Jack Hopkins' song (with a
      chorus) of &ldquo;The King, God bless him,&rdquo; carolled forth by Jack to a novel
      air compounded of the &ldquo;Bay of Biscay&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Frog he would a-wooing go&rdquo;&mdash;when
      poor, discomfited Bob (after turning pale at the voice of his dreaded
      landlady, shrilly calling out, &ldquo;Mr. Saw-yer! Mr. Saw-yer!&rdquo;) turned
      reproachfully on the over-boisterous Jack Hopkins, with, &ldquo;I <i>thought</i>
      you were making too much noise, Jack. You're such a fellow for chorusing!
      You're always at it. You came into the world chorusing; and I believe
      you'll go out of it chorusing.&rdquo; Through their appreciation of which&mdash;more
      even than through their remembrance of Mrs. Raddle's withdrawal of her
      nightcap, with a scream, from over the staircase banisters, on catching
      sight of Mr. Pickwick, saying, &ldquo;Get along with you, you old wretch! Old
      enough to be his grandfather, you willin! You're worse than any of 'em!&rdquo;&mdash;the
      hearers paid to the Reader of Bob Sawyer's Party their last tribute of
      laughter.

    <h2>
      THE CHIMES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As poetical in its conception, and also, intermittently, in its treatment,
      as anything he ever wrote, this Goblin Story of Some Bells that Rang an
      Old Year Out and a New Year In, was, in those purely goblin, or more
      intensely imaginative portions of it, one of the most effective of our
      Author's Readings. Hence its selection by him for his very first Reading
      on his own account in St. Martin's Hall, Long Acre. Listening, as we did,
      then and afterwards, to the tale, as it was told by his own sympathetic
      lips, much of the incongruity, otherwise no doubt apparent in the
      narrative, seemed at those times to disappear altogether. The incongruity,
      we mean, observable between the queer little ticket-porter and the elfin
      phantoms of the belfry; between Trotty Veck, in his &ldquo;breezy,
      goose-skinned, blue-nosed, red-eyed, stony-toed, tooth-chattering&rdquo;
       stand-point by the old church-door, and the Goblin Sight beheld by him
      when he had clambered up, up, up among the roof-beams of the great
      church-tower. As the story was related in its original form, it was rung
      out befittingly from the Chimes in four quarters. As a Reading it was
      subdivided simply into three parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing whatever was preserved (by an error as it always seemed to us) of
      the admirable introduction. The story-teller piqued no one into attention
      by saying&mdash;to begin with&mdash;&ldquo;There are not many people who would
      care to sleep in a church.&rdquo; Adding immediately, with delightful
      particularity, &ldquo;I don't mean at sermon time in warm weather (when the
      thing has actually been done once or twice), but in the night, and alone.&rdquo;
       Not a word was uttered in the exordium of the Reading about the dismal
      trick the night-wind has in those ghostly hours of wandering round and
      round a building of that sort, and moaning as it goes; of its trying with
      a secret hand the windows and the doors, fumbling for some crevice by
      which to enter, and, having got in, &ldquo;as one not finding what it seeks,
      whatever that may be,&rdquo; of its wailing and howling to issue forth again; of
      its stalking through the aisles and gliding round and round the pillars,
      and &ldquo;tempting the deep organ;&rdquo; of its soaring up to the roof, and after
      striving vainly to rend the rafters, flinging itself despairingly upon the
      stones below, and passing mutteringly into the vaults! Anon, coming up
      stealthily&mdash;the Christmas book goes on to say&mdash;&ldquo;It has a ghostly
      sound, lingering within the Altar, where it seems to chant in its wild way
      of Wrong and Murder done, and false Gods worshipped, in defiance of the
      Tables of the Law, which look so fair and smooth, but are so flawed and
      broken. Ugh! Heaven preserve us, sitting snugly round the fire!&mdash;it
      has an awful voice that Wind at Midnight, singing in a church!&rdquo; Of all
      this and of yet more to the like purpose, not one syllable was there in
      the Reading, which, on the contrary, began at once point-blank: &ldquo;High up
      in the steeple of an old church, far above the town, and far below the
      clouds, dwelt the 'Chimes' I tell of.&rdquo; Directly after which the Reader,
      having casually mentioned the circumstance of their just then striking
      twelve at noon, gave utterance to Trotty Yeck's ejaculatory reflection:
      &ldquo;Dinner-time, eh? Ah! There's nothing more regular in its coming round
      than dinner-time, and there's nothing less regular in its coming round
      than dinner.&rdquo; Followed by his innocently complacent exclamation: &ldquo;I wonder
      whether it would be worth any gentleman's while, now, to buy that
      observation for the Papers, or the Parliament!&rdquo; The Reader adding upon the
      instant, with an explanatory aside, that &ldquo;Trotty was only joking,&rdquo;
       striving to console himself doubtless for the exceeding probability there
      was before him, at the moment, of his going, not for the first time,
      dinnerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the thick of his meditations Trotty was startled&mdash;those who ever
      attended this Reading will remember how pleasantly&mdash;by the
      unlooked-for appearance of his pretty daughter Meg. &ldquo;And not alone!&rdquo; as
      she told him cheerily. &ldquo;Why you don't mean to say,&rdquo; was the wondering
      reply of the old ticket-porter, looking curiously the while at a covered
      basket carried in Margaret's hand, &ldquo;that you have brought&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadn't she! It was burning hot&mdash;scalding! He must guess from the
      steaming flavour what it was! Thereupon came the by-play of the Humorist&mdash;after
      the fashion of Munden, who, according to Charles Lamb, &ldquo;understood a leg
      of mutton in its quiddity.&rdquo; It was thus with the Reader when he syllabled,
      with watering lips, guess after guess at the half-opened basket. &ldquo;It ain't&mdash;I
      suppose it ain't polonies? [sniffing]. No. It's&mdash;it's mellower than
      polonies. It's too decided for trotters. Liver? No. There's a mildness
      about it that don't answer to liver. Pettitoes? No. It ain't faint enough
      for pettitoes. It wants the stringiness of cock's heads. And I know it
      ain't sausages. I'll tell you what it is. No, it isn't, neither. Why, what
      am I thinking of! I shall forget my own name next. It's tripe!&rdquo; Forthwith,
      to reward him for having thus hit it off at last so cleverly, Meg, as she
      expressed it, with a flourish, laid the cloth, meaning the
      pocket-handkerchief in which the basin of tripe had been tied up, and
      actually offered the sybarite who was going to enjoy the unexpected
      banquet, a choice of dining-places! &ldquo;Where will you dine, father? On the
      post, or on the steps? How grand we are: two places to choose from!&rdquo; The
      weather being dry, and the steps therefore chosen, those being rheumatic
      only in the damp, Trotty Veck was not merely represented by the Reader as
      feasting upon the tripe, but as listening meanwhile to Meg's account of
      how it had all been arranged that she and her lover Eichard should, upon
      the very next day, that is, upon New Year's Day, be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this agreeable confabulation&mdash;Richard himself having
      in the interim become one of the party&mdash;the little old ticket-porter,
      the pretty daughter, and the sturdy young blacksmith, were suddenly
      scattered. The Reader went on to relate how this happened, with ludicrous
      accuracy, upon the abrupt opening of the door, around the steps of which
      they were gathered&mdash;a flunkey nearly putting his foot in the tripe,
      with this indignant apostrophe, &ldquo;Out of the vays, here, will you? You must
      always go and be a settin' on our steps, must you? You can't go and give a
      turn to none of the neighbours never, can't you?&rdquo; Adding, even, a moment
      afterwards, with an aggrieved air of almost affecting expostulation,
      &ldquo;You're always a being begged and prayed upon your bended knees, you are,
      to let our door-steps be? Can't you let 'em be?&rdquo; Nothing more was seen or
      heard of that footman, and yet in the utterance of those few words of his
      the individuality of the man somehow was thoroughly realised. Observing
      him, listening to him, as he stood there palpably before us, one seemed to
      understand better than ever Thackeray's declaration in regard to those
      same menials in plush breeches, that a certain delightful &ldquo;quivering
      swagger&rdquo; of the calves about them, had for him always, as he expressed it,
      &ldquo;a frantic fascination!&rdquo; Immediately afterwards, however, as the Reader
      turned a new leaf, in place of the momentary apparition of that particular
      flunkey, three very different persons appeared to step across the
      threshold on to the platform. Low-spirited, Mr. Filer, with his hands in
      his trousers-pockets. The red-faced gentleman who was always vaunting,
      under the title of the &ldquo;good old times,&rdquo; some undiscoverable past which he
      perpetually lamented as his deceased Millennium. And finally&mdash;as
      large as life, and as real&mdash;Alderman Cute. As in the original
      Christmas book, so also in the Reading, the one flagrant improbability was
      the consumption by Alderman Cute of the last lukewarm tid-bit of tripe
      left by Trotty Veck down at the bottom of the basin&mdash;its consumption,
      indeed, by any alderman, however prying or gluttonous. Barring that, the
      whole of the first scene of the &ldquo;Chimes&rdquo; was alive with reality, and with
      a curious diversity of human character. In the one that followed, and in
      which Trotty conveyed a letter to Sir Joseph Rowley, the impersonation of
      the obese hall-porter, later on identified as Tugby, was in every way far
      beyond that of the pompous humanitarian member of parliament. A
      hall-porter this proved to be whose voice, when he had found it&mdash;&ldquo;which
      it took him some time to do, for it was a long way off, and hidden under a
      load of meat&rdquo;&mdash;was, in truth, as the Author's lips expressed it, and
      as his pen had long before described it in the book, &ldquo;a fat whisper.&rdquo;
       Afterwards when re-introduced, Tugby hardly, as it appeared to us, came up
      to the original description. When the stout old lady, his supposititious
      wife, formerly, or rather really, all through, Mrs. Chickenstalker, says,
      in answer to his inquiries as to the weather, one especially bitter
      winter's evening, &ldquo;Blowing and sleeting hard, and threatening snow. Dark,
      and very cold&rdquo;&mdash;Tugby's almost apoplectic reply was delicious, no
      doubt, in its suffocative delivery. &ldquo;I'm glad to think we had muffins for
      tea, my dear. It's a sort of night that's meant for muffins. Likewise
      crumpets; also Sally Lunns.&rdquo; But, for all that, we invariably missed the
      sequel&mdash;which, once missed, could hardly be foregone contentedly. We
      recalled to mind, for example, such descriptive particulars in the
      original story as that, in mentioning each successive kind of eatable,
      Tugby did so &ldquo;as if he were musingly summing up his good actions,&rdquo; or
      that, after this, rubbing his fat legs and jerking them at the knees to
      get the fire upon the yet unroasted parts, he laughed as if somebody had
      tickled him! We bore distinctly enough in remembrance, and longed then to
      have heard from the lips of the Reader&mdash;in answer to the dream-wife's
      remark, &ldquo;You're in spirits, Tugby, my dear!&rdquo;&mdash;Tugby's fat, gasping
      response, &ldquo;No,&mdash;No. Not particular. I'm a little elewated. The
      muffins came so pat!&rdquo; Though, even if that addition had been vouchsafed,
      we should still, no doubt, have hungered for the descriptive particulars
      that followed, relating not only how the former hall-porter chuckled until
      he was black in the face&mdash;having so much ado, in fact, to become any
      other colour, that his fat legs made the strangest excursions into the air&mdash;but
      that Mrs. Tugby, that is, Chickenstalker, after thumping him violently on
      the back, and shaking him as if he were a bottle, was constrained to cry
      out, in great terror, &ldquo;Good gracious, goodness, lord-a-mercy, bless and
      save the man! What's he a-doing?&rdquo; To which all that Mr. Tugby can faintly
      reply, as he wipes his eyes, is, that he finds himself a little
      &ldquo;elewated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another omission in the Reading was, if possible, yet more surprising,
      namely, the whole of Will Fern's finest speech: an address full of rustic
      eloquence that one can't help feeling sure would have told wonderfully as
      Dickens could have delivered it. However, the story, foreshortened though
      it was, precisely as he related it, was told with a due regard to its
      artistic completeness. Margaret and Lilian, the old ticket-porter and the
      young blacksmith, were the principal interlocutors. Like the melodrama of
      Victorine, it all turned out, of course, to be no more than &ldquo;the baseless
      fabric of a vision,&rdquo; the central incidents of the tale, at any rate, being
      composed of &ldquo;such stuff as dreams are made of.&rdquo; How it all came to be
      evolved by the &ldquo;Chimes&rdquo; from the slumbering brain of the queer, little old
      ticket-porter was related more fully and more picturesquely, no doubt, in
      the printed narrative, but in the Reading, at the least, it was depicted
      with more dramatic force and passion. The merest glimmering, however, was
      afforded of the ghostly or elfin spectacle, as seen by the &ldquo;mind's eye&rdquo; of
      the dreamer, and which in the book itself was so important an integral
      portion of the tale, as there unfolded, constituting, as it did, for that
      matter, the very soul or spirit of what was meant by &ldquo;The Chimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of the collective chimes of a great city, Victor Hugo has
      remarked in his prose masterpiece that, in an ordinary way, the noise
      issuing from a vast capital is the talking of the city, that at night it
      is the breathing of the city, but that when the bells are ringing it is
      the singing of the city. Descanting upon this congenial theme, the
      poet-novelist observes, in continuation, that while at first the
      vibrations of each bell rise straight, pure, and in a manner separate from
      that of the others, swelling by degrees, they blend, melt, and amalgamate
      in magnificent concert until they become at length one mass of sonorous
      vibrations, which, issuing incessantly from innumerable steeples, float,
      undulate, bound, whirl over the city, expanding at last far beyond the
      horizon the deafening circle of their oscillations. What has been said
      thus superbly, though it may be somewhat extravagantly, by Hugo, in regard
      to &ldquo;that <i>tutti</i> of steeples, that column of sound, that cloud or sea
      of harmony,&rdquo; as he variously terms it, has been said less extravagantly,
      but quite as exquisitely, by Charles Dickens, in regard to the chimes of a
      single belfry. After this New Year's tale of his was first told, there
      rang out from the opposite shores of the Atlantic, that most wonderful
      tintinnabulation in all literature, &ldquo;The Bells&rdquo; of Edgar Poe&mdash;which
      is, among minor poems, in regard to the belfry, what Southey's &ldquo;Lodore&rdquo; is
      to the cataract, full, sonorous, and exhaustive. And there it is, in that
      marvellous little poem of &ldquo;The Bells,&rdquo; that the American lyrist, as it has
      always seemed to us, has caught much of the eltrich force and beauty and
      poetic significance of &ldquo;The Chimes&rdquo; as they were originally rung forth in
      the prose-poetry of the English novelist:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And the people&mdash;ah, the people&mdash;
     They that dwell up in the steeple,
     All alone,
     And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
     In that muffled monotone,
     Feel a glory in so rolling
     On [or from] the human heart a stone&mdash;
     They are neither man nor woman&mdash;
     They are neither brute nor human&mdash;
     They are Ghouls:
     And their king it is who tolls;
     And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
     Rolls
     A pæan from the hells.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Charles Dickens, in his beautiful imaginings in regard to the Spirits of
      the Bells&mdash;something of the grace and goblinry of which, Maclise's
      pencil shadowed forth in the lovely frontispiece to the little volume in
      the form in which it was first of all published&mdash;has exhausted the
      vocabulary of wonder in his elvish delineation of the Goblin Sight beheld
      in the old church-tower on New Year's Eve by the awe-stricken
      ticket-porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Reading one would naturally have liked to have caught some glimpse
      at least of the swarmmg out to view of the &ldquo;dwarf-phantoms, spirits, elfin
      creatures of the Bells;&rdquo; to have seen them &ldquo;leaping, flying, dropping,
      pouring from the Bells,&rdquo; unceasingly; to have realised them anew as a
      listener, just as the imaginary dreamer beheld them all about him in his
      vision&mdash;&ldquo;round him on the ground, above him in the air, clambering
      from him by the ropes below, looking down upon him from the massive
      iron-girded beams, peeping in upon him through the chinks and loopholes in
      the walls, spreading away and away from him in enlarging circles, as the
      water-ripples give place to a huge stone that suddenly comes plashing in
      among them.&rdquo; In their coming and in their going, the sight, it will be
      remembered, was equally marvellous. Whether&mdash;as the Chimes rang out&mdash;we
      read of the dream-haunted, &ldquo;He saw them [these swarming goblins] ugly,
      handsome, crippled, exquisitely formed. He saw them young, he saw them
      old, he saw them kind, he saw them cruel, he saw them merry, he saw them
      grim, he saw them dance, he heard them sing, he saw them tear their hair,
      and heard them howl&rdquo;&mdash;diving, soaring, sailing, perching, violently
      active in their restlessness&mdash;stone, brick, slate, tile, transparent
      to the dreamer's gaze, and pervious to their movements&mdash;the bells all
      the while in an uproar, the great church tower vibrating from parapet to
      basement! Or, whether&mdash;when the Chimes ceased&mdash;there came that
      instantaneous transformation! &ldquo;The whole swarm fainted; their forms
      collapsed, their speed deserted them; they sought to fly, but in the act
      of falling died and melted into air. One straggler,&rdquo; says the book,
      &ldquo;leaped down pretty briskly from the surface of the Great Bell, and
      alighted on his feet, but he was dead and gone before he could turn
      round.&rdquo; After it has been added that some thus gambolling in the tower
      &ldquo;remained there, spinning over and over a little longer,&rdquo; becoming
      fainter, fewer, feebler, and so vanishing&mdash;we read, &ldquo;The last of all
      was one small hunchback, who had got into an echoing corner, where he
      twirled and twirled, and floated by himself a long time; showing such
      perseverance, that at last he dwindled to a leg, and even to a foot,
      before he finally retired; but he vanished in the end, and then the tower
      was silent.&rdquo; Nothing of this, however, was given in the Reading, the
      interest of which was almost entirely restricted to the fancied
      fluctuation of fortunes among the human characters. All of the pathetic
      and most of the comic portions of the tale were happily preserved. When,
      in the persons of the Tugbys, &ldquo;fat company, rosy-cheeked company,
      comfortable company,&rdquo; came to be introduced, there was an instant sense of
      exhilaration among the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar invariably greeted the remark, &ldquo;They were but two, but they were
      red enough for ten.&rdquo; Similarly pronounced was the reception of the casual
      announcement of the &ldquo;stone pitcher of terrific size,&rdquo; in which the good
      wife brought her contribution of &ldquo;a little flip&rdquo; to the final
      merry-making. &ldquo;Mrs. Chicken-stalker's notion of a little flip did honour
      to her character,&rdquo; elicited a burst of laughter that was instantly renewed
      when the Reader added, that &ldquo;the pitcher reeked like a volcano,&rdquo; and that
      &ldquo;the man who carried it was faint.&rdquo; The Drum, by the way&mdash;braced
      tight enough, as any one might admit in the original narrative&mdash;seemed
      rather slackened, and was certainly less effective, in the Reading. One
      listened in vain for the well-remembered parenthesis indicative of its
      being the man himself, and not the instrument. &ldquo;The Drum (who was a
      private friend of Trotty's) then stepped forward, and&rdquo; offered&mdash;evidently
      with a hiccough or two&mdash;his greeting of good fellowship, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; as
      we learn from the book, &ldquo;was received with a general shout.&rdquo; The Humorist
      added thereupon, in his character as Storyteller, not in his capacity as
      Reader, &ldquo;The Drum was rather drunk, by-the-bye; but never mind.&rdquo; A band of
      music, with marrow-bones and cleavers and a set of hand-bells&mdash;clearly
      all of them under the direction of the Drum&mdash;then struck up the dance
      at Meg's wedding. But, after due mention had been made of how Trotty
      danced with Mrs. Chickenstalker &ldquo;in a step unknown before or since,
      founded on his own peculiar trot,&rdquo; the story closed in the book, and
      closed also in the Reading, with words that, in their gentle and
      harmonious flow, seemed to come from the neighbouring church-tower as
      final echoes from &ldquo;The Chimes&rdquo; themselves.

      The hushed silence with which the concluding passages of this Reading were
      always listened to, spoke more eloquently than any applause could possibly
      have done, of the sincerity of the emotions it awakened. A cursory glance
      at the audience confirmed the impression produced by that earlier evidence
      of their rapt and breathless attention. It is the simplest truth to say
      that at those times many a face illustrated involuntarily the loveliest
      line in the noblest ode in the language, where Dryden has sung even of a
      warrior&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And now and then a sigh he heaved,
      And tears began to flow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The subdued voice of the Reader, moreover, accorded tenderly with one's
      remembrance of his own acknowledgment ten years after his completion of
      the book from which this story was extracted, that with a heavy heart he
      had walked the streets of Paris alone during the whole of one winter's
      night, while he and his little friend parted company for ever! Charles
      Young's son, the vicar of Ilminster, has, recently, in his own Diary
      appended to his memoir of his father, the tragedian, related a curious
      anecdote, illustrative, in a very striking way, of the grief&mdash;the
      profound and overwhelming grief&mdash;excited in a mind and heart like
      those of Lord Jeffrey, by the imaginary death of another of these
      dream-children of Charles Dickens. The editor of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
      we there read, was surprised by Mrs. Henry Siddons, seated in his library,
      with his head on the table, crying. &ldquo;Delicately retiring,&rdquo; we are then
      told, &ldquo;in the hope that her entrance had been unnoticed,&rdquo; Mrs. Siddons
      observed that Jeffrey raised his head and was kindly beckoning her back.
      The Diary goes on: &ldquo;Perceiving that his cheek was flushed and his eyes
      suffused with tears, she apologised for her intrusion, and begged
      permission to withdraw. When he found that she was seriously intending to
      leave him, he rose from his chair, took her by both hands, and led her to
      a seat.&rdquo; Then came the acknowledgment prefaced by Lord Jeffrey's remark
      that he was &ldquo;a great goose to have given way so.&rdquo; Little Nell was dead!
      The newly published number of &ldquo;Master Humphrey's Clock&rdquo; (No. 44) was lying
      before him, in which he had just been reading of the general bereavement!
    </p>
    <p>
      Referring to another of these little creatures' deaths, that of Tiny Tim,
      Thackeray wrote in the July number of <i>Fraser</i>, for 1844, that there
      was one passage regarding it about which a man would hardly venture to
      speak in print or in public &ldquo;any more than he would of any other
      affections of his private heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It has been related, even of the burly demagogue, O'Connell, that on first
      reading of Nell's death in the Old Curiosity Shop, he exclaimed&mdash;his
      eyes running over with tears while he flung the leaves indignantly out of
      the window&mdash;&ldquo;he should not have killed her&mdash;he should not have
      killed her: she was too good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finally, another Scotch critic and judge, Lord Cockburn, writing to the
      Novelist on the very morrow of reading the memorable fifth number of
      &ldquo;Dombey and Son,&rdquo; in which the death of Little Paul is so exquisitely
      depicted&mdash;offering his grateful acknowledgments to the Author for the
      poignant grief he had caused him&mdash;added, &ldquo;I have felt my heart
      purified by those tears, and blessed and loved you for making me shed
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly can it be matter for wonder, therefore, remarking how the printed
      pages would draw such tokens of sympathy from men like Cockburn, and
      Jeffrey, and Thackeray, and O'Connell, that a mixed audience showed traces
      of emotion when the profoundly sympathetic voice of Dickens himself
      related this story of the Life and Death of Little Dombey. Yet the
      pathetic beauty of the tale, for all that, was only dimly hinted at
      throughout,&mdash;the real pathos of it, indeed, being only fully
      indicated almost immediately before its conclusion. Earlier in the
      Reading, in fact, the drollery of the comic characters introduced&mdash;of
      themselves irresistible&mdash;would have been simply paramount, but for
      the incidental mention of the mother's death, when clinging to that frail
      spar within her arms, her little daughter, &ldquo;she drifted out upon the dark
      and unknown sea that rolls round all the world.&rdquo; Paul's little wistful
      face looked out every now and then, it is true, from among the fantastic
      forms and features grouped around him, with a growing sense upon the
      hearer of what was really meant by the child being so &ldquo;old-fashioned.&rdquo; But
      the ludicrous effect of those surrounding characters was nothing less than
      all-mastering in its predominance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Mrs. Pipchin, for example, that grim old lady with a mottled
      face like bad marble, who acquired an immense reputation as a manager of
      children, by the simple device of giving them everything they didn't like
      and nothing that they did! Whose constitution required mutton chops hot
      and hot, and buttered toast in similar relays! And with whom one of Little
      Dombey's earliest dialogues in the Reading awakened invariably such bursts
      of hearty laughter! Seated in his tall, spindle-legged arm-chair by the
      fire, staring steadily at the exemplary Pipchin, Little Paul, we were
      told, was asked [in the most snappish voice possible], by that austere
      female, What he was thinking about?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; [in the gentlest childlike voice] said Paul, without the least
      reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you thinking about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm&mdash;thinking&mdash;how old&mdash;you must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't say such things as that, young gentleman. That'll never do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not [slowly and wonderingly]?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind, sir [shorter and sharper than ever]. Remember the story
      of the little boy that was gored to death by a mad bull for asking
      questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the bull [in a high falsetto voice and with greater deliberation than
      ever] was mad, how did he know that the boy asked questions? Nobody can go
      and whisper secrets to a mad bull. I don't believe that story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Dombey's fellow-sufferers at Mrs. Pipchin's were hardly less
      ludicrous in their way than that bitter old victim of the Peruvian mines
      in her perennial weeds of black bombazeen. Miss Pankey, for instance, the
      mild little blue-eyed morsel of a child who was instructed by the Ogress
      that &ldquo;nobody who sniffed before visitors ever went to heaven!&rdquo; And her
      associate in misery, one Master Bitherstone, from India, who objected so
      much to the Pipchinian system, that before Little Dombey had been in the
      house five minutes, he privately consulted that gentleman if he could
      afford him any idea of the way back to Bengal! What the Pipchinian system
      was precisely, the Reader indicated perhaps the most happily by his way of
      saying, that instead of its encouraging a child's mind to develop itself,
      like a flower, it strove to open it by force, like an oyster. Fading
      slowly away while he is yet under Mrs. Pipchin's management, poor little
      Paul, as the audience well knew, was removed on to Doctor Blimber's
      Academy for Young Gentlemen. There the humorous company gathered around
      Paul immediately increased. But, before his going amongst them, the Reader
      enabled us more vividly to realise, by an additional touch or two, the
      significance of the peculiarity of being &ldquo;old fashioned,&rdquo; for which the
      fading child appeared in everybody's eyes so remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wheeled down to the beach in a little invalid-carriage, he would cling
      fondly to his sister Florence. He would say to any chance child who might
      come to bear him company [in a soft, drawling, half-querulous voice, and
      with the gravest look], &ldquo;Go away, if you please. Thank you, but I don't
      want you.&rdquo; He would wonder to himself and to Floy what the waves were
      always saying&mdash;always saying! At about the middle of the 47th page of
      the Reading copy of this book about Little Dombey, the copy from which
      Dickens Read, both in England and America, there is, in his handwriting,
      the word&mdash;&ldquo;Pause.&rdquo; It occurs just in between Little Dombey's
      confiding to his sister, that if she were in India he should die of being
      so sorry and so lonely! and the incident of his suddenly waking up at
      another time from a long sleep in his little carriage on the shingles, to
      ask her, not only &ldquo;What the rolling waves are saying so constantly, but
      What place is over there?&mdash;far away!&mdash;looking eagerly, as he
      inquires, towards some invisible region beyond the horizon!&rdquo; That
      momentary pause will be very well remembered by everyone who attended this
      Reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      One single omission we are still disposed to regret in the putting
      together of the materials for this particular Reading from the original
      narrative. In approaching Dr. Blimber's establishment for the first time,
      we would gladly have witnessed the sparring-match, as one may say, on the
      very threshold, between Mrs. Pipchin the Ogress in bombazeen and the
      weak-eyed young man-servant who opens the door! The latter of whom, having
      &ldquo;the first faint streaks or early dawn of a grin on his countenance&mdash;(it
      was mere imbecility)&rdquo; as the Author himself explains parenthetically&mdash;Mrs.
      Pipchin at once takes it into her head, is inspired by impudence, and
      snaps at accordingly. Of this we saw nothing, however, in the Reading. We
      heard nothing of Mrs. Pipchin's explosive, &ldquo;How dare you laugh behind the
      gentleman's back?&rdquo; or of the weak-eyed young man's answering in
      consternation, &ldquo;I ain't a laughing at nobody, ma'am.&rdquo; Any more than of the
      Ogress saying a while later, &ldquo;You're laughing again, sir!&rdquo; or of the young
      man, grievously oppressed, repudiating the charge with, &ldquo;I <i>ain't</i>. I
      never see such a thing as this!&rdquo; The old lady as she passed on with, &ldquo;Oh!
      he was a precious fellow,&rdquo; leaving him, who was in fact all meekness and
      incapacity, &ldquo;affected even to tears by the incident.&rdquo; If we saw nothing,
      however, of that retainer of Dr. Blimber, we were introduced to another,
      meaning the blue-coated, bright-buttoned butler, &ldquo;who gave quite a winey
      flavour to the table-beer&mdash;he poured it out so superbly!&rdquo; We had Dr.
      Blimber himself, besides, with his learned legs, like a clerical
      pianoforte&mdash;a bald head, highly polished, and a chin so double, it
      was a wonder how he ever managed to shave into the creases. We had Miss
      Blimber, in spectacles, like a ghoul, &ldquo;dry and sandy with working in the
      graves of deceased languages.&rdquo; We had Mrs. Blimber, not learned herself,
      but pretending to be so, which did quite as well, languidly exclaiming at
      evening parties, that if she could have known Cicero, she thought she
      could have died contented. We had Mr. Feeder, clipped to the stubble,
      grinding out his classic stops like a barrel-organ of erudition. Above
      all, we had Toots, the head boy, or rather &ldquo;the head and shoulder boy,&rdquo; he
      was so much taller than the rest! Of whom in that intellectual
      forcing-house (where he had &ldquo;gone through&rdquo; everything so completely, that
      one day he &ldquo;suddenly left off blowing, and remained in the establishment a
      mere stalk&rdquo;) people had come at last to say, &ldquo;that the Doctor had rather
      overdone it with young Toots, and that when he began to have whiskers he
      left off having brains.&rdquo; From the moment when Young Toots's voice was
      first heard, in tones so deep, and in a manner so sheepish, that &ldquo;if a
      lamb had roared it couldn't have been more surprising,&rdquo; saying to Little
      Dombey with startling suddenness, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;&mdash;every time the
      Reader opened his lips, as speaking in that character, there was a burst
      of merriment. His boastful account always called forth laughter&mdash;that
      his tailor was Burgess and Co., &ldquo;fash'nable, but very dear.&rdquo; As also did
      his constantly reiterated inquiries of Paul&mdash;always as an entirely
      new idea&mdash;&ldquo;I say&mdash;it's not of the slightest consequence, you
      know, but I should wish to mention it&mdash;how are you, you know?&rdquo; Hardly
      less provocative of mirth was Briggs's confiding one evening to Little
      Dombey, that his head ached ready to split, and &ldquo;that he should wish
      himself dead if it wasn't for his mother and a blackbird he had at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wonderful fun used to be made by the Reader of the various incidents at
      the entertainment given upon the eve of the vacations by Doctor and Mrs.
      Blimber to the Young Gentlemen and their Friends, when &ldquo;the hour was
      half-past seven o'clock, and the object was quadrilles.&rdquo; The Doctor pacing
      up and down in the drawing-room, full dressed, before anybody had arrived,
      &ldquo;with a dignified and unconcerned demeanour, as if he thought it barely
      possible that one or two people might drop in by-and-by!&rdquo; His exclaiming,
      when Mr. Toots and Mr. Feeder were announced by the butler, and as if he
      were extremely surprised to see them, &ldquo;Aye, aye, aye! God bless my soul!&rdquo;
       Mr. Toots, one blaze of jewellery and buttons, so undecided, &ldquo;on a calm
      revision of all the circumstances,&rdquo; whether it were better to have his
      waistcoat fastened or unfastened both at top and bottom, as the arrivals
      thickened, so influencing him by the force of example, that at the last he
      was &ldquo;continually fingering that article of dress as if he were performing
      on some instrument!&rdquo; Thoroughly enjoyable though the whole scene was in
      its throng of ludicrous particulars, it merely led the way up appreciably
      and none the less tenderly, for all the innocent laughter, to the last and
      supremely pathetic incidents of the story as related thenceforth (save
      only for one startling instant) <i>sotto voce</i>, by the Reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exceptional moment here alluded to, when his voice was suddenly
      raised, to be hushed again the instant afterwards, came at the very
      opening of the final scene by Little Dombey's death-bed, where the
      sunbeams, towards evening, struck through the rustling blinds and quivered
      on the opposite wall like golden water. Overwhelmed, as little Paul was
      occasionally, with &ldquo;his only trouble,&rdquo; a sense of the swift and rapid
      river, &ldquo;he felt forced,&rdquo; the Reader went on to say, &ldquo;to try and stop it&mdash;to
      stem it with his childish hands, or choke its way with sand&mdash;and when
      he saw it coming on, resistless, he cried out!&rdquo; Dropping his voice from
      that abrupt outcry instantly afterwards, to the gentlest tones, as he
      added, &ldquo;But a word from Florence, who was always at his side, restored him
      to himself&rdquo;&mdash;the Reader continued in those subdued and tender accents
      to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child's pity for his father's sorrowing, was surpassed only, as all
      who witnessed this Reading will readily recollect, by the yet more
      affecting scene with his old nurse. Waking upon a sudden, on the last of
      the many evenings, when the golden water danced in shining ripples on the
      wall, waking mind and body, sitting upright in his bed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is this? Is this my old nurse?&rdquo; asked the child, regarding with a
      radiant smile a figure coming in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. No other stranger would have shed those tears at sight of him,
      and called him her dear boy, her pretty boy, her own poor blighted child.
      No other woman would have stooped down by his bed and taken up his wasted
      hand and put it to her lips and breast, as one who had some right to
      fondle it. No other woman would have so forgotten everybody there but him
      and Floy, and been so full of tenderness and pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's words coming then so lovingly: &ldquo;Floy! this is a kind good
      face! I am glad to see it again. Don't go away, old nurse! Stay here! Good
      bye!&rdquo; prepared one exquisitely for the rest. &ldquo;Not goodbye?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, yes!
      good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the end! The child having been laid down again with his arms clasped
      round his sister's neck, telling her that the stream was lulling him to
      rest, that now the boat was out at sea and that there was shore before
      him, and&mdash;Who stood upon the bank! Putting his hands together &ldquo;as he
      had been used to do at his prayers &ldquo;&mdash;not removing his arms to do it,
      but folding them so behind his sister's neck&mdash;&ldquo;Mamma is like you,
      Floy!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I know her by the face! But tell them that the picture
      on the stairs at school is not Divine enough. The light about the head is
      shining on me as I go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came two noble passages, nobly delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      First&mdash;when there were no eyes unmoistened among the listeners&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The golden ripple on the wall came back again, and nothing else stirred
      in the room. The old, old fashion! The fashion that came in with our first
      garments, and will last unchanged until our race has run its course, and
      the wide firmament is rolled up like a scroll. The old, old fashion&mdash;Death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And lastly&mdash;with a tearful voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank God, all who see it, for that older fashion yet of Immortality!
      And look upon us, Angels of young children, with regards not quite
      estranged, when the swift river bears us to the ocean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remembering which exquisite words as he himself delivered them, having the
      very tones of his voice still ringing tenderly in our recollection, the
      truth of that beautiful remark of Dean Stanley's comes back anew as though
      it were now only for the first time realised, where, in his funeral sermon
      of the 19th June, 1870, he said that it was the inculcation of the lesson
      derived from precisely such a scene as this which will always make the
      grave of Charles Dickens seem &ldquo;as though it were the very grave of those
      little innocents whom he created for our companionship, for our
      instruction, for our delight and solace.&rdquo; The little workhouse-boy, the
      little orphan girl, the little cripple, who &ldquo;not only blessed his father's
      needy home, but softened the rude stranger's hardened conscience,&rdquo; were
      severally referred to by the preacher when he gave this charming thought
      its affecting application. But, foremost among these bewitching children
      of the Novelist's imagination, might surely be placed the child-hero of a
      story closing hardly so much with his death as with his apotheosis.

    <h2>
      MR CHOPS, THE DWARF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It remains still a matter of surprise how so much was made out of this
      slight sketch by the simple force of its humorous delivery. &ldquo;Mr. Chops,
      the Dwarf,&rdquo; as, indeed, was only befitting, was the smallest of all the
      Readings. The simple little air that so caught the dreamer's fancy, when
      played upon the harp by Scrooge's niece by marriage, is described after
      all, as may be remembered by the readers of the Carol, to to have been
      intrinsically &ldquo;a mere nothing; you might learn to whistle it in two
      minutes.&rdquo; Say that in twenty minutes, or, at the outside, in half-an-hour,
      any ordinarily glib talker might have rattled through these comic
      recollections of Mr. Magsman, yet, when rattled through by Dickens, the
      laughter awakened seems now in the retrospect to have been altogether out
      of proportion. In itself the subject was anything but attractive,
      relating, as it did, merely to the escapade of a monstrosity. The
      surroundings are ignoble, the language is illiterate, the narrative from
      first to last is characterised by its grotesque extravagance. Yet the
      whole is presented to view in so utterly ludicrous an aspect, that one
      needs must laugh just as surely as one listened. Turning over the leaves
      now, and recalling to mind the hilarity they used to excite even among the
      least impressionable audience whenever they were fluttered (there are not
      a dozen of them altogether) on the familiar reading-desk, one marvels over
      the success of such an exceedingly small oddity as over the remembrance,
      let us say, of the brilliant performance of a fantasia on the jew's-harp
      by Rubenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, slight though it is, the limning all through has touches of
      the most comic suggestiveness. Magsman's account of the show-house during
      his occupancy is sufficiently absurd to begin with&mdash;&ldquo;the picter of
      the giant who was himself the heighth of the house,&rdquo; being run up with a
      line and pulley to a pole on the roof till &ldquo;his 'ed was coeval with the
      parapet;&rdquo; the picter of the child of the British Planter seized by two Boa
      Constrictors, &ldquo;not that we never had no child, nor no Constrictors
      either;&rdquo; similarly, the picter of the Wild Ass of the Prairies, &ldquo;not that
      <i>we</i> never had no wild asses, nor wouldn't have had 'em at a gift.&rdquo;
       And to crown all, the picter of the Dwarf&mdash;who was &ldquo;a uncommon small
      man, he really was. Certainly not so small as he was made out to be; but
      where <i>is</i> your Dwarf as is?&rdquo; A picter &ldquo;like him, too considering,
      with George the Fourth, in such a state of astonishment at him as his
      Majesty couldn't with his utmost politeness and stoutness express.&rdquo; Wrote
      up the Dwarf was, we are told by Mr. Magsman, as Major Tpschoffski&mdash;&ldquo;nobody
      couldn't pronounce the name,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;and it never was intended anybody
      should.&rdquo; Corrupted into Chopski by the public, he gets called in the line
      Chops, partly for that reason, &ldquo;partly because his real name, if he ever
      had any real name (which was dubious), was Stakes.&rdquo; Wearing a diamond ring
      &ldquo;(or quite as good to look at)&rdquo; on his forefinger, having the run of his
      teeth, &ldquo;and he was a Woodpecker to eat&mdash;but all dwarfs are,&rdquo;
       receiving a good salary, and gathering besides as his perquisites the
      ha'pence collected by him in a Chaney sarser at the end of every
      entertainment, the Dwarf never has any money somehow. Nevertheless, having
      what his admiring proprietor considers &ldquo;a fine mind, a poetic mind,&rdquo; Mr.
      Chops indulges himself in the pleasing delusion that one of these days he
      is to Come Into his Property, his ideas respecting which are never
      realised by him so powerfully as when he sits upon a barrel-organ and has
      the handle turned! &ldquo;Arter the wibration has run through him a little
      time,&rdquo; says Mr. Magsman, &ldquo;he screeches out, 'Toby, I feel my property
      a-coming&mdash;gr-r-rind away! I feel the Mint a-jingling in me. I'm
      a-swelling out into the Bank of England!' Such,&rdquo; reflectively observes his
      proprietor, &ldquo;is the influence of music on a poetic mind!&rdquo; Adding, however,
      immediately afterwards, &ldquo;Not that he was partial to any other music but a
      barrel-organ; on the contrairy, hated it.&rdquo; Indulging in day-dreams about
      Coming Into his Property and Going Into Society, for which he feels
      himself formed, and to aspire towards which is his avowed ambition, the
      mystery, as to where the Dwarf's salary and ha'pence all go, is one day
      cleared up by his winning a prize in the Lottery, a half-ticket for the
      twenty-five thousand pounder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chops Comes Into his Property&mdash;twelve thousand odd hundred.
      Further than that, he Goes Into Society &ldquo;in a chay and four greys with
      silk jackets.&rdquo; It was at this turning-point in the career of his
      large-headed but diminutive hero that the grotesque humour of the Reader
      would play upon the risible nerves of his hearers, as, according to Mr.
      Disraeli's phrase, Sir Robert Peel used to play upon the House of Commons,
      &ldquo;like an old fiddle.&rdquo; Determined to Go Into Society in style, with his
      twelve thousand odd hundred, Mr. Chops, we are told, &ldquo;sent for a young man
      he knowed, as had a very genteel appearance, and was a Bonnet at a
      gaming-booth. Most respectable brought up,&rdquo; adds Mr. Magsman&mdash;&ldquo;father
      having been imminent in the livery-stable line, but unfortunate in a
      commercial crisis through painting a old grey ginger-bay, and sellin' him
      with a pedigree.&rdquo; In intimate companionship with this Bonnet, &ldquo;who said
      his name was Normandy, which it warn't,&rdquo; Mr. Magsman, on invitation by
      note a little while afterwards, visits Mr. Chops at his lodgings in Pall
      Mall, London, where he is found carousing not only with the Bonnet but
      with a third party, of whom we were then told with unconscionable gravity,
      &ldquo;When last met, he had on a white Roman shirt, and a bishop's mitre
      covered with leopard-skin, and played the clarionet all wrong in a band at
      a Wild Beast Show.&rdquo; How the reverential Magsman, finding the three of them
      blazing away, blazes away in his turn while remaining in their company,
      who, that once heard it, has forgotten? &ldquo;I made the round of the bottles,&rdquo;
       he says&mdash;evidently proud of his achievement&mdash;&ldquo;first separate (to
      say I had done it), and then mixed 'em altogether (to say I had done it),
      and then tried two of 'em as half-and-half, and then t'other two;
      altogether,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;passin' a pleasin' evenin' with a tendency to feel
      muddled.&rdquo; How all Mr. Chop's blazing away is to terminate everybody but
      himself perceives clearly enough from the commencement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normandy having bolted with the plate, and &ldquo;him as formerly wore the
      bishop's mitre&rdquo; with the jewels, the Dwarf gets out of society by being,
      as he significantly expresses it, &ldquo;sold out,&rdquo; and in this plight returns
      penitently one evening to the show-house of his still-admiring proprietor.
      Mr. Magsman happens at the moment to be having a dull <i>tête-à-tête</i>
      with a young man without arms, who gets his living by writing with his
      toes, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; says the low-spirited narrator, &ldquo;I had taken on for a month&mdash;though
      he never drawed&mdash;except on paper.&rdquo; Hearing a kicking at the
      street-door, &ldquo;'Halloa!' I says to the young man, 'what's up?' He rubs his
      eyebrows with his toes, and he says, 'I can't imagine, Mr. Magsman'&mdash;which
      that young man [with an air of disgust] never <i>could</i> imagine
      nothin', and was monotonous company.&rdquo; Mr. Chops&mdash;&ldquo;I never dropped the
      'Mr.' with him,&rdquo; says his again proprietor; &ldquo;the world might do it, but
      not me&rdquo;&mdash;eventually dies. Having sat upon the barrel-organ over
      night, and had the handle turned through all the changes, for the first
      and only time after his fall, Mr. Chops is found on the following morning,
      as the disconsolate Magsman expresses it, &ldquo;gone into much better society
      than either mine or Pall Mall's.&rdquo; Out of such unpromising materials as
      these could the alembic of a genius all-embracing in its sympathies
      extract such an abundance of innocent mirth&mdash;an illiterate showman
      talking to us all the while about such people as the Bonnet of a
      gaming-booth, or a set of monstrosities he himself has, for a few coppers,
      on exhibition. Yet, as Mr. Magsman himself remarks rather proudly when
      commenting on his own establishment, &ldquo;as for respectability,&mdash;if
      threepence ain't respectable, what is?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE POOR TRAVELLER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Apart altogether from the Readings of Charles Dickens, has the reader of
      this book any remembrance of the original story of &ldquo;The Poor Traveller&rdquo;?
      If he has, he will recognise upon the instant the truth of the words in
      which we would here speak of it, as of one of those, it may be, slight but
      exquisite sketches, which are sometimes, in a happy moment, thrown off by
      the hand of a great master. Comparatively trivial in itself&mdash;carelessly
      dashed off, apparently hap-hazard&mdash;having no pretension about it in
      the least, it is anything, in short, but a finished masterpiece. Yet, for
      all that, it is marked, here and there, by touches so felicitous and
      inimitable in their way, that we hardly find the like in the artist's more
      highly elaborated and ambitious productions. Not that one would speak of
      it, however, as of a drawing upon toned paper in neutral tint, or as of a
      picture pencilled in sepia or with crayons; one would rather liken it to a
      radiant water-colour, chequered with mingled storm and sunshine, sparkling
      with lifelike effects, and glowing with brilliancy. And yet the little
      work is one, when you come to look into it, that is but the product of a
      seemingly artless <i>abandon</i>, in which without an effort the most
      charming results have been arrived at, obviously upon the instant, and
      quite unerringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trudging down to Chatham, footsore and without a farthing in his pocket,
      it is in this humble guise first of all that he comes before us, this Poor
      Traveller. Christian name, Eichard, better known as Dick, his own surname
      dropped upon the road, he assumes that of Doubledick&mdash;being
      thenceforth spoken of all through the tale, even to the very end of it, by
      his new name, as Eichard Doubledick. A scapegrace, a ne'er-do-well, an
      incorrigible, hopeless of himself, despaired of by others, he has &ldquo;gone
      wrong and run wild.&rdquo; His heart, still in the right place, has been sealed
      up. &ldquo;Betrothed to a good and beautiful girl whom he had loved better than
      she&mdash;or perhaps even he&mdash;believed,&rdquo; he had given her cause, in
      an evil hour, to tell him solemnly that she would never marry any other
      man; that she would live single for his sake, but that her lips, &ldquo;that
      Mary Marshall's lips,&rdquo; would never address another word to him on earth,
      bidding him in the end&mdash;Go! and Heaven forgive him! Hence, in point
      of fact, this journey of his on foot down to Chatham, for the purpose of
      enlisting, if possible, in a cavalry regiment, his object being to get
      shot, though he himself thinks in his devil-may-care indifference, that
      &ldquo;he might as well ride to death as be at the trouble of walking.&rdquo;
       Premising simply that his hero's age is at this time twenty-two, and his
      height five foot ten, and that, there being no cavalry at the moment in
      Chatham, he enlists into a regiment of the line, where he is glad to get
      drunk and forget all about it, the Author readily made the path clear for
      the opening up of his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Charles Dickens introduced this tale among his Readings, how
      beautifully he related it! After recounting how Private Doubledick was
      clearly going to the dogs, associating himself with the dregs of every
      regiment, seldom being sober and constantly under punishment, until it
      became plain at last to the whole barracks that very soon indeed he would
      come to be flogged, when the Reader came at this point to the words&mdash;&ldquo;Now
      the captain of Doubledick's company was a young gentleman not above five
      years his senior, whose eyes had an expression in them which affected
      Private Doubledick in a very remarkable way&rdquo;&mdash;the effect was
      singularly striking. Out of the Reader's own eyes would look the eyes of
      that Captain, as the Author himself describes them: &ldquo;They were bright,
      handsome, dark eyes, what are called laughing eyes generally, and, when
      serious, rather steady than severe.&rdquo; But, he immediately went on to say,
      they were the only eyes then left in his narrowed world that could not be
      met without a sense of shame by Private Doubledick. Insomuch that if he
      observed Captain Taunton coming towards him, even when he himself was most
      callous and unabashed, &ldquo;he would rather turn back and go any distance out
      of the way, than encounter those two handsome, dark, bright eyes.&rdquo; Here it
      was that came, what many will still vividly remember, as one of the most
      exquisitely portrayed incidents in the whole of this Reading&mdash;the
      interview between Captain Taunton and Private Doubledick!
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, having passed forty-eight hours in the Black Hole, has been
      just summoned, to his great dismay, to the Captain's quarters. Having
      about him all the squalor of his incarceration, he shrinks from making his
      appearance before one whose silent gaze even was a reproach. However, not
      being so mad yet as to disobey orders, he goes up to the officers'
      quarters immediately upon his release from the Black Hole, twisting and
      breaking in his hands as he goes along a bit of the straw that had formed
      its decorative furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come in!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private Doubledick pulled off his cap, took a stride forward and stood in
      the light of the dark bright eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that moment until the end of the interview, the two men alternately
      were standing there distinctly before the audience upon the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubledick! do you know where you are going to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and very fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon one did not hear the words simply, one saw it done precisely as
      it is described in the original narrative: &ldquo;Private Richard Doubledick
      turned the straw of the Black Hole in his mouth and made a <i>miserable</i>
      salute of acquiescence.&rdquo; Captain Taunton then remonstrates with him thus
      earnestly: &ldquo;Doubledick, since I entered his Majesty's service, a boy of
      seventeen, I have been pained to see many men of promise going that road;
      but I have never been <i>so</i> pained to see a man determined to make the
      shameful journey, as I have been, ever since you joined the regiment, to
      see <i>you</i>.&rdquo; At this point in the printed story, as it was originally
      penned, one reads that &ldquo;Private Richard Doubledick began to find a film
      stealing over the floor at which he looked; also to find the legs of the
      Captain's breakfast-table turning crooked as if he saw them through
      water.&rdquo; Although those words are erased in the reading copy, and were not
      uttered, pretty nearly the effect of them was visible when, after a
      momentary pause, the disheartened utterance was faltered out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only a common soldier, sir. It signifies very little what such a
      poor brute comes to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the next remonstrance from his officer, Doubledick's words
      are blurted out yet more despairingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to get shot soon, sir, and then the regiment, and the world
      together, will be rid of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What are the descriptive words immediately following this in the printed
      narrative? They also were visibly expressed upon the platform. &ldquo;Looking up
      he met the eyes that had so strong an influence over him. He put his hand
      before his own eyes, and the breast of his disgrace-jacket swelled as if
      it would fly asunder.&rdquo; His observant adviser thereupon quietly but very
      earnestly remarks, that he &ldquo;would rather see this in him (Doubledick) than
      he would see five thousand guineas counted out upon the table between them
      for a gift to his (the Captain's) good mother,&rdquo; adding suddenly, &ldquo;Have you
      a mother?&rdquo; Doubledick is thankful to say she is dead. Reminded by the
      Captain that if his praises were sounded from mouth to mouth through the
      whole regiment, through the whole army, through the whole country, he
      would wish she had lived to say with pride and joy, &ldquo;He is my son!&rdquo;
       Doubledick cries out, &ldquo;Spare me, sir! She would never have heard any good
      of me. She would never have had any pride or joy in owning herself my
      mother. Love and compassion she might have had, and would always have had,
      I know; but not&mdash;spare me, sir! I am a broken wretch quite at your
      mercy.&rdquo; By this time, according to the words of the writing, according
      only to the eloquent action of the Reading, &ldquo;He had turned his face to the
      wall and stretched out his <i>imploring</i> hand.&rdquo; How eloquently that
      &ldquo;imploring hand&rdquo; spoke in the agonised, dumb supplication of its movement,
      coupled as it was with the shaken frame and the averted countenance, those
      who witnessed this Reading will readily recall to their recollection. As
      also the emotion expressed in the next broken utterances exchanged by the
      interlocutors:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Taunton, interrupted for the moment, adding&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are at the crisis of your fate, my friend. Hold your course unchanged
      a little longer, and you know what must happen, <i>I</i> know better than
      ever you can imagine, that after that has happened you are a lost man. No
      man who could shed such tears could bear such marks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doubledick, replying in a low shivering voice, &ldquo;I fully believe it, sir,&rdquo;
       the young Captain adds&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a man in any station can do his duty, and in doing it can earn his
      own respect, even if his case should be so very unfortunate and so very
      rare, that he can earn no other man's. A common soldier, poor brute though
      you called him just now, has this advantage in the stormy times we live
      in, that he always does his duty before a host of sympathising witnesses.
      Do you doubt that he may so do it as to be extolled through a whole
      regiment, through a whole army, through a whole country? Turn while you
      may yet retrieve the past and try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a nearly bursting heart Richard cries out, &ldquo;I will! I ask but one
      witness, sir!&rdquo; The reply is instant and significant, &ldquo;I understand you. I
      will be a watchful and a faithful one.&rdquo; It is a compact between them, a
      compact sealed and ratified. &ldquo;I have heard from Private Doubledick's own
      lips,&rdquo; said the narrator, and in tones how manly and yet how tender in
      their vibration, &ldquo;that he dropped down upon his knee, kissed that
      officer's hand, arose, and went out of the light of the dark bright eyes,
      an altered man.&rdquo; From the date to them both of this memorable interview he
      followed the two hither and thither among the battle-fields of the great
      war between England in coalition with the other nations of Europe and
      Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever Captain Taunton led, there, &ldquo;close to him, ever at his side, firm
      as a rock, true as the sun, brave as Mars,&rdquo; would for certain be found
      that famous soldier Sergeant Doubledick. As Sergeant-Major the latter is
      shown, later on, upon one desperate occasion cutting his way single-handed
      through a mass of men, recovering the colours of his regiment, and
      rescuing his wounded Captain from the very jaws of death &ldquo;in a jungle of
      horses' hoofs and sabres&rdquo;&mdash;for which deed of gallantry and all but
      desperation, he is forthwith raised from the ranks, appearing no longer as
      a non-commissioned officer, but as Ensign Doubledick. At last, one fatal
      day in the trenches, during the siege of Badajos, Major Taunton and Ensign
      Doubledick find themselves hurrying forward against a party of French
      infantry. At this juncture, at the very moment when Doubledick sees the
      officer at the head of the enemy's soldiery&mdash;&ldquo;a courageous, handsome,
      gallant officer of five-and-thirty&rdquo;&mdash;waving his sword, and with an
      eager and excited cry rallying his men, they fire, and Major Taunton has
      dropped. The encounter closing within ten minutes afterwards on the
      arrival of assistance to the two Englishmen, &ldquo;the best friend man ever
      had&rdquo; is laid upon a coat spread out upon the wet clay by the heart-riven
      subaltern, whom years before his generous counsel had rescued from
      ignominious destruction. Three little spots of blood are visible on the
      shirt of Major Taunton as he lies there with the breast of his uniform
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Doubledick,&mdash;I am dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love of Heaven, no! Taunton! My preserver, my guardian angel, my
      witness! Dearest, truest, kindest of human beings! Taunton! For God's
      sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To listen to that agonised entreaty as it started from the trembling and
      one could almost have fancied whitened lips of the Reader, was to be with
      him there upon the instant on the far-off battle-field. Taunton dies &ldquo;with
      his hand upon the breast in which he had revived a soul.&rdquo; Doubledick,
      prostrated and inconsolable in his bereavement, has but two cares
      seemingly for the rest of his existence&mdash;one to preserve a packet of
      hair to be given to the mother of the friend lost to him; the other, to
      encounter that French officer who had rallied the men under whose fire
      that friend had fallen. &ldquo;A new legend,&rdquo; quoth the narrator, &ldquo;now began to
      incubate among our troops; and it was, that when he and the French officer
      came face to face once more, there would be weeping in France.&rdquo; Failing to
      meet him, however, through all the closing scenes of the great war,
      Doubledick, by this time promoted to his lieutenancy, follows the old
      regimental colours, ragged, scarred, and riddled with shot, through the
      fierce conflicts of Quatre Bras and Ligny, falling at last desperately
      wounded&mdash;all but dead&mdash;upon the field of Waterloo.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, having been tenderly nursed during the total eclipse of an
      appallingly lengthened period of unconsciousness, he wakes up at last in
      Brussels to find that during a little more than momentary and at first an
      utterly forgotten interval of his stupor, he has been married to the
      gentle-handed nurse who has been all the while in attendance upon him, and
      who is no other, of coarse, than his faithful first love, Mary Marshall!
      How, returning homewards, an invalided hero, Captain Doubledick becomes,
      in a manner, soon afterwards, the adopted son of Major Taunton's mother!
      How the latter, having gone, some time later, on a visit to a French
      family near Aix, is followed by her other son, her other self, he has
      almost come to be, &ldquo;now a hardy, handsome man in the full vigour of life,&rdquo;
       on his receiving from the head of the house a gracious and courtly
      invitation for &ldquo;the honour of the company of cet homme si justement
      célèbre, Monsieur le Capitaine Richard Double-dick!&rdquo; These were among the
      incidents in due sequence immediately afterwards recounted!
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the old chateau upon a fête-day, when the household are
      scattered abroad in the gardens and shrubberies at their rejoicings,
      Captain Double-dick passes through the open porch into the lofty stone
      hall. There, being a total stranger, he is almost scared by the intrusive
      clanking of his boots. Suddenly he starts back, feeling his face turn
      white! For, in the gallery looking down at him, is the French officer
      whose picture he has carried in his mind so long and so far. The latter,
      disappearing in another instant for the staircase, enters directly
      afterwards with a bright sudden look upon his countenance, &ldquo;Such a look as
      it had worn in that fatal moment,&rdquo; so well and so terribly remembered! All
      this was portrayed with startling vividness by the Author of the little
      sketch in his capacity as the sympathetic realizer of the dreams of his
      own imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exquisite was the last glimpse of the delineation, when the Captain&mdash;after
      many internal revulsions of feeling, while he gazes through the window of
      the bed-chamber allotted to him in the old château, &ldquo;whence he could see
      the smiling prospect and the peaceful vineyards &ldquo;&mdash;thinks musingly to
      himself, &ldquo;Spirit of my departed friend, is it through thee these better
      thoughts are rising in my mind! Is it thou who hast shown me, all the way
      I have been drawn to meet this man, the blessings of the altered time! Is
      it thou who hast sent thy stricken mother to me, to stay my angry hand! Is
      it from thee the whisper comes, that this man only did his duty as thou
      didst&mdash;and as I did through thy guidance, which saved me, here on
      earth&mdash;and that he did no more!&rdquo; Then it was, we were told, there
      came to him the second and crowning resolution of his life: &ldquo;That neither
      to the French officer, nor to the mother of his departed friend, nor to
      any soul while either of the two was living, would he breathe what only <i>he</i>
      knew.&rdquo; Then it was that the author perfected his Reading by the simple
      utterance of its closing words&mdash;&ldquo;And when he touched that French
      officer's glass with his own that day at dinner, he secretly forgave him&mdash;forgave
      him in the name of the Divine Forgiver.&rdquo; With a moral no less noble and
      affecting, no less grand and elevating than this, the lovely idyll closed.
      The final glimpse of the scene at the old Aix château was like the view of
      a sequestered orchard through the ivied porchway of a village church. The
      concluding words of the prelection were like the sound of the organ
      voluntary at twilight, when the worshippers are dispersing.

    <h2>
      MRS. GAMP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A whimsical and delightful recollection comes back to the writer of these
      pages at the moment of inscribing as the title of this Reading the name of
      the preposterous old lady who is the real heroine of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit.&rdquo;
       It is the remembrance of Charles Dickens's hilarious enjoyment of a casual
      jest thrown out, upon his having incidentally mentioned&mdash;as
      conspicuous among the shortcomings of the first acting version of that
      story upon the boards of the Lyceum&mdash;the certainly surprising fact
      that Mrs. Gamp's part, as originally set down for Keeley, had not a single
      &ldquo;which&rdquo; in it. &ldquo;Why, it ought actually to have begun with one!&rdquo; was the
      natural exclamation of the person he was addressing, who added instantly,
      with affected indignation, &ldquo;Not one? Why, next they'll be playing Macbeth
      without the Witches!&rdquo; The joyous laugh with which this ludicrous conceit
      was greeted by the Humorist, still rings freshly and musically in our
      remembrance. And the recollection of it is doubtless all the more vivid
      because of the mirthful retrospect having relation to one of the most
      recent of Dickens's blithe home dinners in his last town residence
      immediately before his hurried return to Gad's Hill in the summer of 1870.
      Although we were happily with him afterwards, immediately before the time
      came when we could commune with him no more, the occasion referred to is
      one in which we recall him to mind as he was when we saw him last at his
      very gayest, radiant with that sense of enjoyment which it was his
      especial delight to diffuse around him throughout his life so abundantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all his humorous creations, Mrs. Gamp is perhaps the most intensely
      original and the most thoroughly individualised. She is not only a
      creation of character, she is in herself a creator of character. To the
      Novelist we are indebted for Mrs. Gamp, but to Mrs. Gamp herself we are
      indebted for Mrs. Harris. That most mythical of all imaginary beings is
      certainly quite unique; she is strictly, as one may say, <i>sui generis</i>
      in the whole world of fiction. A figment born from a figment; one fancy
      evolved from another; the shadow of a shadow. If only in remembrance of
      that one daring adumbration from Mrs. Gamp'sinner consciousness, that
      purely supposititious entity &ldquo;which her name, I'll not deceive you, is
      Harris,&rdquo; one would say that Mr. Mould, the undertaker, has full reason for
      exclaiming, in regard to Mrs. Gamp, &ldquo;I'll tell you what, that's a woman
      whose intellect is immensely superior to her station in life. That's a
      woman who observes and reflects in a wonderful manner.&rdquo; Mr. Mould becomes
      so strongly impressed at last with a sense of her exceptional merits, that
      in a deliciously ludicrous outburst of professional generosity he caps the
      climax of his eulogium by observing, &ldquo;She's the sort of woman, now, that
      one would almost feel disposed to bury for nothing&mdash;and do it neatly,
      too!&rdquo; Thoroughly akin, by the way, to which exceedingly questionable
      expression of goodwill on the part of Mr. Mould, is Mrs. Gamp's equally
      confiding outburst of philanthropy from <i>her</i> point of view, where
      she remarks&mdash;of course to her familiar, as Socrates when communing
      with his Daemon&mdash;&ldquo;'Mrs. Harris,' I says to her, 'don't name the
      charge, for if I could afford to lay my fellow-creeturs out for nothink, I
      would gladly do it, sich is the love I bears 'em.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A benevolent unbosoming, or self-revelation, that last, on the part of
      Mrs. Gamp, so astoundingly outspoken of its kind, that it forces upon one,
      in regard to her whole character, the almost inevitable reflection that
      her grotesque and inexhaustible humour, like Falstaff's irrepressible and
      exhilarating wit, redeems what would be otherwise in itself utterly
      irredeemable. For, as commentators have remarked, in regard to Shakspere's
      Fat Knight, that Sir John is an unwieldy mass of every conceivable bad
      quality, being, among other things, a liar, a coward, a drunkard, a
      braggart, a cheat, and a debauchee, one might bring, if not an equally
      formidable, certainly an equally lengthened, indictment against the whole
      character of Mrs. Gamp, justifying the validity of each disreputable
      charge upon the testimony of her own evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its way, the impersonation of Mrs. Gamp by her creator was nearly as
      surprising as his original delineation of her in his capacity as Novelist.
      Happily, to bring out the finer touches of the humorous in her
      portraiture, there were repeated asides in the Reading, added to which
      other contrasting characters were here and there momentarily introduced.
      Mr. Pecksniff&mdash;hardly recognisable, by the way, <i>as</i> Mr.
      Pecksniff&mdash;took part, but a very subordinate part, in the
      conversation, as did Mr. Mould also, and as, towards the close of it,
      likewise did Mrs. Prig of Bartlemy's. But, monopolist though Mrs. Gamp
      showed herself to be in her manner of holding forth, her talk never
      degenerated into a monologue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pecksniff setting forth in a hackney cabriolet to-arrange, on behalf
      of Jonas Chuzzlewit, for the funeral of the latter's father, in regard to
      which he is enjoined to spare no expense, arrives, in due course, in
      Kings-gate-street, High Holborn, in quest of the female functionary&mdash;&ldquo;a
      nurse and watcher, and performer of nameless offices about the dead, whom
      the undertaker had recommended.&rdquo; His destination is reached when he stands
      face to face with the lady's lodging over the bird-fancier's, &ldquo;next door
      but one to the celebrated mutton-pie shop, and directly opposite to the
      original cats'-meat warehouse.&rdquo; Here Mr. Pecksniff's performance upon the
      knocker naturally arouses the whole neighbourhood, it, the knocker, being
      so ingeniously constructed as to wake the street with ease, without making
      the smallest impression upon the premises to which it was addressed.
      Everybody is at once under the impression that, as a matter of course, he
      is &ldquo;upon an errand touching not the close of life, but the other end&rdquo;&mdash;the
      married ladies, especially, crying out with uncommon interest, &ldquo;Knock at
      the winder, sir, knock at the winder! Lord bless you, don't lose no more
      time than you can help,&mdash;knock at the winder!&rdquo; Mrs. Gamp herself,
      when roused, is under the same embarrassing misapprehension. Immediately,
      however, Mr. Pecksniff has explained the object of his mission, Mrs. Gamp,
      who has a face for all occasions, thereupon putting on her mourning
      countenance, the surrounding matrons, while rating her visitor roundly,
      signify that they would be glad to know what he means by terrifying
      delicate females with &ldquo;his corpses!&rdquo; The unoffending gentleman eventually,
      after hustling Mrs. Gamp into the cabriolet, drives off &ldquo;overwhelmed with
      popular execration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here it is that Mrs. Gamp's distinctive characteristics begin to assert
      themselves conspicuously. Her labouring under the most erroneous
      impressions as to the conveyance in which she is travelling, evidently
      confounding it with mail-coaches, insomuch that, in regard to her luggage,
      she clamours to the driver to &ldquo;put it in the boot,&rdquo; her absorbing anxiety
      about the pattens, &ldquo;with which she plays innumerable games of quoits upon
      Mr. Pecksniff's legs,&rdquo; her evolutions in that confined space with her most
      prominently visible chattel, &ldquo;a species of gig umbrella,&rdquo; prepare the way
      for her still more characteristic confidences. Then in earnest&mdash;she
      had spoken twice before that from her window over the bird-fancier's&mdash;but
      then in earnest, on their approaching the house of mourning, her voice, in
      the Reading, became recognisable. A voice snuffy, husky, unctuous, the
      voice of a fat old woman, one so fat that she is described in the book as
      having had a difficulty in looking over herself&mdash;a voice, as we read
      elsewhere in the novel, having borne upon the breeze about it a peculiar
      fragrance, &ldquo;as if a passing fairy had hiccoughed, and had previously been
      to a wine-vaults.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And so the gentleman's dead, sir! Ah! the more's the pity!'&mdash;(<i>She
      didn't even know his name</i>.)&mdash;'But it's as certain as being born,
      except that we can't make our calc'lations as exact. Ah, dear!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simply to hear those words uttered by the Reader&mdash;especially the
      interjected words above italicised&mdash;was to have a relish of
      anticipation at once for all that followed. Mrs. Gamp's pathetic allusion,
      immediately afterwards, to her recollection of the time &ldquo;when Gamp was
      summonsed to his long home,&rdquo; and when she &ldquo;see him a-laying in the
      hospital with a penny-piece on each eye, and his wooden leg under his left
      arm,&rdquo; not only confirmed the delighted impression of the hearers as to
      their having her there before them in her identity, but was the signal for
      the roars of laughter that, rising and falling in volume all through the
      Reading, terminated only some time after its completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after came the first introduction by her of the name of Mrs.
      Harris. &ldquo;At this point,&rdquo; observed the narrator, &ldquo;she was fain to stop for
      breath. And,&rdquo; he went on directly to remark, with a combination of candour
      and seriousness that were in themselves irresistibly ludicrous, &ldquo;advantage
      may be taken of the circumstance to state that a fearful mystery
      surrounded this lady of the name of Harris, whom no one in the circle of
      Mrs. Gamp's acquaintance had ever seen; neither did any human being know
      her place of residence&mdash;the prevalent opinion being that she was a
      phantom of Mrs. Gamp's brain, created for the purpose of holding
      complimentary dialogues with her on all manner of subjects.&rdquo; Eminently
      seasonable, as a preliminary flourish in this way, is the tribute paid by
      her to Mrs. Gamp's abstemiousness, on the understanding that is, that the
      latter's one golden rule of life, is complied with&mdash;&ldquo;'Leave the
      bottle on the chimbley-piece, and don't ast me to take none, but let me
      put my lips to it when I am so dispoged, and then, Mrs. Harris, I says, I
      will do what I am engaged to, according to the best of my ability.' 'Mrs.
      Gamp' she says, in answer, 'if ever there was a sober creetur to be got at
      eighteen-pence a day for working people, and three-and-six for
      gentlefolks,&mdash;night-watching being a extra charge,&mdash;you are that
      inwallable person. Never did I think, till I know'd you, as any woman
      could sick-nurse and monthly likeways, on the little that you takes to
      drink.' 'Mrs. Harris, ma'am,' I says to her, 'none on us knows what we can
      do till we tries; and wunst <i>I</i> thought so too. But now,' I says, 'my
      half a pint of porter fully satisfies; perwisin', Mrs. Harris, that it's
      brought reg'lar, and draw'd mild.'&rdquo; Not but occasionally even that modest
      &ldquo;sip of liquor&rdquo; she finds so far &ldquo;settling heavy on the chest&rdquo; as to
      necessitate, every now and then, a casual dram by way of extra quencher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so arranged in the Reading that, immediately upon the completion of
      Mrs. Gamp's affecting narrative of the confidential opinions of her
      sobriety entertained by Mrs. Harris, Mr. Mould, the undertaker,
      opportunely presented to the audience his well-remembered countenance&mdash;&ldquo;a
      face in which a queer attempt at melancholy was at odds with a smirk of
      satisfaction.&rdquo; The impersonation, here, was conveyed in something better
      than the unsatisfactory hint by which that attempted in regard to Mr.
      Pecksniff was alone to be expressed. Speaking of Old Chuzzlewit's funeral,
      as ordered by his bereaved son, Mr. Jonas, with &ldquo;no limitation, positively
      no limitation in point of expense,&rdquo; the undertaker observes to Mr.
      Pecksniff, &ldquo;This is one of the most impressive cases, sir, that I have
      seen in the whole course of my professional experience. Anything so filial
      as this&mdash;anything so honourable to human nature, anything <i>so</i>
      expensive, anything so calculated to reconcile all of us to the world we
      live in&mdash;never yet came under my observation. It only proves, sir,
      what was so forcibly expressed by the lamented poet,&mdash;buried at
      Stratford,&mdash;that there is good in everything.&rdquo; Even the very manner
      of his departure was delicious: &ldquo;Mr. Mould was going away with a brisk
      smile, when he remembered the occasion,&rdquo; we read in the narrative and saw
      on the platform. &ldquo;Quickly becoming depressed again, he sighed; looked into
      the crown of his hat, as if for comfort; put it on without finding any;
      and slowly departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spirit and substance of the whole Reading, however, were, as a matter
      of course, Mrs. Gamp and her grotesque remembrances, drawn, these latter
      from the inexhaustible fund of her own personal and mostly domestic
      experiences. &ldquo;Although the blessing of a daughter,&rdquo; she observed, in one
      of her confiding retrospects, &ldquo;was deniged me, which, if we had had one,
      Gamp would certainly have drunk its little shoes right off its feet, as
      with one precious boy he did, and arterwards sent the child a errand to
      sell his wooden leg for any liquor it would fetch as matches in the rough;
      which was truly done beyond his years, for ev'ry individgie penny that
      child lost at tossing for kidney pies, and come home arterwards quite
      bold, to break the news, and offering to drown'd himself if such would be
      a satisfaction to his parents.&rdquo; At another moment, when descanting upon
      all her children collectively in one of her faithfully reported addresses
      to her familiar: &ldquo;'My own family,' I says, 'has fallen out of three-pair
      backs, and had damp doorsteps settled on their lungs, and one was turned
      up smilin' in a bedstead unbeknown. And as to husbands, there's a wooden
      leg gone likeways home to its account, which in its constancy of walking
      into public-'ouses, and never coming out again till fetched by force, was
      quite as weak as flesh, if not weaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, when those who were assisting at this Reading, as the phrase is,
      had related to them the manner in which Mrs. Gamp entered on her official
      duties in the sick chamber, they appeared to be assisting also at her
      toilette: as, for example, when &ldquo;she put on a yellow nightcap of
      prodigious size, in shape resembling a cabbage, having previously divested
      herself of a row of bald old curls, which could scarcely be called false
      they were so innocent of anything approaching to deception.&rdquo; One missed
      sadly at this point in the later version of this Reading what was included
      in her first conversation on the doormat as to her requirements for supper
      enumerated after this fashion, &ldquo;in tones expressive of faintness,&rdquo; to the
      housemaid: &ldquo;I think, young woman, as I could peck a little bit of pickled
      salmon, with a little sprig of fennel and a sprinkling o' white pepper. I
      takes new bread, my dear, with jest a little pat o' fredge butter and a
      mossel o' cheese. With respect to ale, if they draws the Brighton Tipper
      at any 'ouse nigh here, I takes that ale at night, my love; not as I cares
      for it myself, but on accounts of its being considered wakeful by the
      doctors; and whatever you do, young woman, don't bring me more than a
      shilling's worth of gin-and-water, warm, when I rings the bell a second
      time; for that is always my allowange, and I never takes a drop beyond. In
      case there should be sich a thing as a cowcumber in the 'ouse, I'm rather
      partial to 'em, though I am but a poor woman.&rdquo; Winding all up,&mdash;with
      one of those amazing confusions of a Scriptural recollection which prompts
      her at another time in the novel to exclaim, in regard to the Ankworks
      package, &ldquo;'I wish it was in Jonadge's belly, I do,' appearing to confound
      the prophet with the whale in that mysterious aspiration,&rdquo;&mdash;by
      observing at this point, &ldquo;Rich folks may ride on camels, but it ain't so
      easy for 'em to see out of a needle's eye. That is my comfort, and I hope
      I knows it.&rdquo; One whole chapter of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit,&rdquo; with the exception
      of the merest fragment of it&mdash;<i>the</i> chapter pre-eminently in
      relation to Mrs. Gamp&mdash;we always regretted as having been either
      overlooked or purposely set aside in the compilation both of the earlier
      and the later version of this Reading, the chapter, that is, in which Mrs.
      Gamp and Mrs. Prig converse together in the former's sleeping apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere description of the interior of that chamber, related by the
      Author's lips, would have been so irresistibly ridiculous&mdash;the tent
      bedstead ornamented with pippins carved in timber, that tumbled down on
      the slightest provocation like a wooden shower-bath&mdash;the chest of
      drawers, from which the handles had long been pulled off, so that its
      contents could only be got at either by tilting the whole structure until
      all the drawers fell out together, or by opening each of them singly with
      knives like oysters&mdash;the miscellaneous salad bought for twopence by
      Betsey Prig on condition that the vendor could get it all into her pocket
      (including among other items a green vegetable of an expansive nature, of
      such magnificent proportions that before it could be got either in or out
      it had to be shut up like an umbrella), which was happily accomplished in
      High Holborn, to the breathless interest of a hackney-coach stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      One inestimable portion, however, of this memorable occasion of festivity
      between those frequend pardners, Betsey Prig and Sairey Gamp, was, by a
      most ingenious dovetailing together of two disjointed parts, incorporated
      with the adroitly compacted materials of a Reading that was as brief as
      the laughter provoked by it was boisterous and inextinguishable. As to the
      manner of the dovetailing, it will be readily recalled to recollection.
      Immediately upon Mrs. Gamp's awaking at the close of her night watch, we
      were told that Mrs. Prig relieved punctually, but that she relieved in an
      ill temper. &ldquo;The best among us have their failings, and it must be
      conceded of Mrs. Prig,&rdquo; observed the Reader with a hardly endurable
      gravity of explanation, &ldquo;that if there were a blemish in the goodness of
      her disposition, it was a habit she had of not bestowing all its sharp and
      acid properties upon her patients (as a thoroughly amiable woman would
      have done), but of keeping a considerable remainder for the service of her
      friends.&rdquo; Looking offensively at Mrs. Gamp, and winking her eye, as Mrs.
      Prig does immediately upon her entrance, it is felt by the former to be
      necessary that Betsey should at once be made sensible of her exact station
      in society; wherefore Mrs. Gamp prefaced a remonstrance with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Harris, Betsey&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother Mrs. Harris!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that the Reader added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gamp looked at Betsey with amazement, incredulity, and indignation.
      Mrs. Prig, winking her eye tighter, folded her arms and uttered these
      tremendous words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't believe there's no sich a person!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With these expressions, she snapped her fingers, once, twice, thrice,
      each time nearer to Mrs. Gamp, and then turned away as one who felt that
      there was now a gulf between them that nothing could ever bridge across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The most comic of all the Readings closed thus abruptly with a roar.

    <h2>
      BOOTS AT THE HOLLY TREE INN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Even the immortal Boots at the White Hart, Borough, who was first revealed
      to us in a coarse striped waistcoat with black calico sleeves and blue
      glass buttons, drab breeches and gaiters, and who answered to the name of
      Sam, would not, we are certain, have disdained to have been put in
      friendly relations with Cobbs, as one in every way worthy of his
      companionship. The Boots at the Holly Tree Inn, though more lightly
      sketched, was quite as much of an original creation in his way as that
      other Christmas friend of ours, the warm-hearted and loquacious Cheap
      Jack, Doctor Marigold. And each of those worthies, it should be added, had
      really about him an equal claim to be regarded, as an original creation,
      as written, or as impersonated by the Author. As a character orally
      portrayed, Cobbs was fully on a par with Doctor Marigold. Directly the
      Reader opened his lips, whether as the Boots or as the Cheap Jack, the
      Novelist seemed to disappear, and there instead, talking glibly to us from
      first to last just as the case might happen to be, was either the patterer
      on the cart footboard or honest Cobbs touching his hair with a bootjack.
      His very first words not only lead up to his confidences, but in the same
      breath struck the key-note of his character. &ldquo;Where had he been? Lord,
      everywhere! What had he been? Bless you, everything a'most. Seen a good
      deal? Why, of course he had. Would be easier for him to tell what he
      hadn't seen than what he had. Ah! A deal, it would. What was the curiosest
      thing he'd seen? Well! He didn't know&mdash;couldn't name it momently&mdash;unless
      it was a Unicorn, and he see <i>him</i> over at a Fair. But&rdquo;&mdash;and
      here came the golden retrospect, a fairy tale of love told by a tavern
      Boots, and told all through, moreover, as none but a Boots could tell it&mdash;&ldquo;Supposing
      a young gentleman not eight year'old, was to run away with a fine young
      woman of seven, might I think <i>that</i> a queer start? Certainly! Then,
      that was a start as he himself had had his blessed eyes on&mdash;and he'd
      cleaned the shoes they run away in&mdash;and they was so little he
      couldn't get his hand into 'em.&rdquo; Whereupon, following up the thread of his
      discourse, Boots would take his crowd of hearers, quite willingly on their
      part, into the heart of the charming labyrinth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descriptive powers of Cobbs, it will be admitted, were for one thing
      very remarkable. Master Harry Walmers' father, for instance, he hits off
      to a nicety in a phrase or two. &ldquo;He was a gentleman of spirit, and good
      looking, and held his head up when he walked, and had what you may call
      Fire about him:&rdquo; adding, that he wrote poetry, rode, ran, cricketed,
      danced and acted, and &ldquo;done it all equally beautiful.&rdquo; Another and a very
      significant touch, by the way, was imparted to that same portraiture later
      on, just, in point of fact before the close of Cobbs's reminiscence, and
      one so lightly given that it was conveyed through a mere passing
      parenthesis&mdash;namely, where the young father was described by Boots as
      standing beside Master Harry Walmers' bed, in the Holly Tree Inn, looking
      down at the little sleeping face, &ldquo;looking wonderfully like it,&rdquo; says
      Cobbs, who adds, &ldquo;(they do say as he ran away with Mrs. Walmers).&rdquo;
       Although Boots described Master Harry's father from the first as &ldquo;uncommon
      proud of him, as his only child, you see,&rdquo; the worthy fellow took especial
      care at once to add, that &ldquo;he didn't spoil him neither.&rdquo; Having a will of
      his own, and a eye of his own, and being one that would be minded, while
      he never tired of hearing the fine bright boy &ldquo;sing his songs about Young
      May Moons is beaming, love, and When he who adores thee has left but the
      name, and that: still,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;he kept the command over the child,
      and the child <i>was</i> a child, and it's very much to be wished more of
      'em was.&rdquo; At the particular period referred to in this portion of his
      narrative, Boots informed us pleasantly, that he came to know all about it
      by reason of his being in his then capacity as Mr. Wahners'
      under-gardener, always about in the summer time, near the windows, on the
      lawn &ldquo;a-mowing and sweeping, and weeding and pruning, and this and that&rdquo;&mdash;with
      his eyes and ears open, of course, we may presume, in a manner befitting
      his intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, there was after all nothing better in the delivery of the whole
      of this Reading, than the utterance of the two words italicised below in
      the first dialogue, reported by Boots as having taken place between
      himself and Master Harry Walmers, junior, when &ldquo;that mite,&rdquo; as Boots calls
      him, stops one day, along with the fine young woman of seven already
      mentioned, where Boots (then under-gardener, remember) was hoeing weeds in
      the gravel:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cobbs,' he says, 'I like <i>you.</i>' 'Do you, sir? I'm proud to hear
      it.' 'Yes, I do, Cobbs. Why do I like you, do you think, Cobbs?' 'Don't
      know, Master Harry, I'm sure.' 'Because Norah likes you, Cobbs.' 'Indeed,
      sir? That's very gratifying.' 'Gratifying, Cobbs? It is better than
      millions of the brightest diamonds, to be liked by Norah?' '<i>Certainly</i>,
      sir.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confirmed naturally enough in his good opinion of Cobbs by this thorough
      community of sentiment, Master Harry, who has been given to understand
      from the latter that he is going to leave, and, further than that, on
      inquiring, that he wouldn't object to another situation &ldquo;if it was a good
      'un,&rdquo; observes, while tucking that other mite in her little sky-blue
      mantle under his arm, &ldquo;Then, Cobbs, you shall be our head gardener when we
      are married.&rdquo; Boots, thereupon, in the person of the Reader, went on to
      describe how &ldquo;the babies with their long bright curling hair, their
      sparkling eyes, and their beautiful light tread, rambled about the garden
      deep in love,&rdquo; sometimes here, sometimes there, always under his own
      sympathetic and admiring observation, until one day, down by the pond, he
      heard Master Harry say, &ldquo;Adorable Norah, kiss me and say you love me to
      distraction.&rdquo; Altogether Cobbs seemed exactly, and with delicious humour,
      to define the entire situation when he declared, that &ldquo;on the whole the
      contemplation of them two babies had a tendency to make him feel as if he
      was in love himself&mdash;only he didn't know who with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The delightful gravity of countenance (with a covert sparkle in the eye
      where the daintiest indications of fun were given by the Reader) lent a
      charm of its own to the merest nothing, comparatively, in the whimsical
      dialogues he was reporting. Master Harry, for example, having confided to
      Cobbs one evening, when the latter was watering the flowers, that he was
      going on a visit to his grandmama at York&mdash;&ldquo;'Are you indeed, sir? I
      hope you'll have a pleasant time. I'm going into Yorkshire myself, when I
      leave here.' 'Are you going to your grandmama's, Cobbs?' 'No, sir. I
      haven't got such a thing.' 'Not as a grandmama, Cobbs?' 'No, sir.'&rdquo;
       Immediately after which, on the boy observing to his humble confidant,
      that he shall be so glad to go because &ldquo;Norah's going,&rdquo; Cobbs, naturally
      enough, as it seemed, took occasion to remark, &ldquo;You'll be all right then,
      sir, with your beautiful sweetheart by your side.&rdquo; Whereupon we realised
      more clearly than ever the delicate whimsicality of the whole delineation,
      when we saw, as well as heard, the boy return a-flushing, &ldquo;Cobbs, I never
      let anybody joke about that when I can prevent them,&rdquo; Cobbs immediately
      explaining in all humility, &ldquo;It wasn't a joke, sir&mdash;wasn't so meant.&rdquo;
       No wonder, Boots had exclaimed previously: &ldquo;And the courage of that boy!
      Bless you, he'd have throwed off his little hat and tucked up his little
      sleeves and gone in at a lion, he would&mdash;if they'd happened to meet
      one, and she [Norah] had been frightened.&rdquo; At the close of Boots's record
      of this last-quoted conversation with Master Harry, came one of the
      drollest touches in the Reading&mdash;&ldquo;'Cobbs,' says that boy, 'I'll tell
      you a secret. At Norah's house, they have been joking her about me, and
      [with a wondering look] pretending to laugh at our being engaged!
      Pretending to make game of it, Cobbs!' 'Such, sir,' I says, 'is the
      depravity of human natur.'&rdquo; A glance during the utterance of which words,
      either at the Reader himself or at his audience, was something enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly less inspiriting in its way was the incidental mention, directly
      after this by Cobbs, of the manner in which he gave Mr. Walmers notice,
      not that he'd anything to complain of&mdash;&ldquo;'Thanking you, sir, I find
      myself as well sitiwated here as I could hope to be anywheres. The truth
      is, sir, that I'm a going to seek my fortun.' 'O, indeed, Cobbs?' he says,
      'I hope you may find it.'&rdquo; Boots hereupon giving his audience the
      assurance, with the characteristic touch of the bootjack to his forehead,
      that &ldquo;he hadn't found it yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the delectable account of the elopement&mdash;full, true, and
      particular&mdash;from the veracious lips of Cobbs himself, at that time,
      and again some years afterwards, when he came to call up his
      recollections, Boots at the Holly Tree Inn. Passages here and there in his
      description of the incident were irrisistibly laughable. Master Harry's
      going down to the old lady's in York, for example, &ldquo;which old lady were so
      wrapt up in that child as she would have give that child the teeth in her
      head (if she had had any).&rdquo; The arrival of &ldquo;them two children,&rdquo; again at
      the Holly Tree Inn, he, as bold as brass, tucking her in her little
      sky-blue mantle under his arm, with the memorable dinner order, &ldquo;Chops and
      cherry pudding for two!&rdquo; Their luggage, even, when gravely enumerated&mdash;the
      lady having &ldquo;a parasol, a smelling bottle, a round and a half of cold
      buttered toast, eight peppermint drops, and a doll's hair-brush;&rdquo; the
      gentleman having &ldquo;about half a dozen yards of string, a knife, three or
      four sheets of writing paper folded up surprisingly small, a orange, and a
      chaney mug with his name on it.&rdquo; Several of the little chance phrases, the
      merest atoms of exclamation here and there, will still be borne in mind as
      having had an intense flavour of fun about them, as syllabled in the
      Reading. Boots's &ldquo;Sir, to you,&rdquo; when his governor, the hotel-keeper,
      proposes to run over to York to quiet their friends' minds, while Cobbs
      keeps his eye upon the innocents! Master Harry's replying to Boots'
      suggestion, that they should wile away the time by a walk down Love-lane&mdash;&ldquo;'Get
      out with you, Cobbs!'&mdash;that was that there boy's expression.&rdquo; The
      glee of the children was prettily told too on their finding &ldquo;Good Cobbs!
      Dear Cobbs!&rdquo; among the strangers around them at their temporary
      halting-place. They themselves appearing smaller than ever in his eyes, by
      reason of his finding them &ldquo;with their little legs entirely off the
      ground, of course&mdash;and it really is not possible to express how small
      them children looked!&mdash;on a e-normous sofa;&rdquo; immense at any time, but
      looking like a Great Bed of Ware then by comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, during the governor's absence in search of their friends, Cobbs,
      feeling himself all the while to be &ldquo;the meanest rascal for deceiving 'em,
      that ever was born,&rdquo; gets up a cock and a bull story about a pony he's
      acquainted with, who'll take them on nicely to Gretna Green&mdash;but who
      was not at liberty the first day, and the next was only &ldquo;half clipped, you
      see, and couldn't be took out in that state for fear it should strike to
      his inside&rdquo;&mdash;was related with the zest of one who had naturally the
      keenest relish possible for every humorous particular. Finding the lady in
      tears one time when Boots goes to see how the runaway couple are getting
      on, &ldquo;Mrs. Harry Walmers, junior, fatigued, sir?&rdquo; asks Cobbs. &ldquo;Yes, she is
      tired, Cobbs; but she is not used to be away from home, and she has been
      in low spirits again. Cobbs, do you think you could bring a biffin,
      please?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I ask your pardon, sir, What was it you &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;I think a Norfolk biffin would rouse her, Cobbs.&rdquo; Restoratives of that
      kind, Boots would seem to have regarded as too essential to Mrs. Harry
      Walmers junior's happiness. Hence, when he comes upon the pair over their
      dinner of &ldquo;biled fowl and bread-and-butter pudding,&rdquo; Boots privately owns
      that &ldquo;he could have wished to have seen her more sensible to the woice of
      love, and less abandoning of herself to the currants in the pudding.&rdquo;
       According to Cobbs's own account of the gentleman, however, it should be
      added that <i>he</i> too could play his part very effectively at table,
      for&mdash;having mentioned another while, how the two of them had ordered
      overnight sweet milk-and-water and toast and currant jelly for breakfast&mdash;when
      Cobbs comes upon them the next morning at their meal, he describes Master
      Harry as sitting behind his breakfast cup &ldquo;a tearing away at the jelly as
      if he had been his own father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remorseful in the thought of betraying them, Boots at one moment declared,
      that rather than combine any longer against them, he would by preference
      &ldquo;have had it out in half-a-dozen rounds with the governor!&rdquo; And at another
      time, when the said governor had returned from York, &ldquo;with Mr. Walmers and
      a elderly lady,&rdquo; Boots, while conducting Mr. Walmers upstairs, could not
      for the life of him help pausing at the room door, with, &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon, sir, I hope you are not angry with Master Harry. For Master
      Harry's a fine boy, sir, and will do you credit and honour.&rdquo; Boots
      signifying while he related the circumstance, that &ldquo;if the fine boy's
      father had contradicted him in the state of mind in which he then was, he
      should have 'fetched him a crack' and took the consequences.&rdquo; As for the
      appreciation of Master Harry by the female dependents at the Holly Tree,
      there were two allusions to <i>that</i>&mdash;one general, as may be said,
      the other particular&mdash;that were always the most telling hits, the two
      chief successes of the Reading. Who that once heard it, for example, has
      forgotten the Author's inimitable manner of saying, as the Boots&mdash;&ldquo;The
      way in which the women of that house&mdash;<i>without</i> exception&mdash;<i>every</i>
      one of 'em&mdash;married <i>and</i> single&mdash;took to that boy when
      they heard the story, is surprising. It was as much as could be done to
      keep 'em from dashing into the room and kissing him. They climbed up all
      sorts of places, at the risk of their lives, to look at him through a pane
      of glass. <i>They was seven deep at the key-hole!</i>&rdquo; The climax of fun
      came naturally at the close, however, when, having described how Mr.
      Walmers lifted his boy up to kiss the sleeping &ldquo;little warm face of little
      Mrs. Harry Walmers, junior,&rdquo; at the moment of their separation, Boots,
      that is the Reader, cried out in the shrill voice of one of the
      chambermaids, &ldquo;<i>It's a shame to part 'em!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two reflections indulged in by Boots during the course of his narrative,
      being among the pleasantest in connection with this most graceful of all
      the purely comic Readings, may here, while closing these allusions to it,
      be recalled to mind not inappropriately. One&mdash;where Cobbs &ldquo;wished
      with all his heart there was any impossible place where them two babies
      could have made an impossible marriage, and have lived impossibly happy
      ever afterwards.&rdquo; The other&mdash;where, with genial sarcasm, Boots
      propounds this brace of opinions by way of general summing up&mdash;&ldquo;Firstly,
      that there are not many couples on their way to be married who are half as
      innocent as them two children. Secondly, that it would be a jolly good
      thing for a great many couples on their way to be married, if they could
      only be stopped in time, and brought back separate.&rdquo; With which cynical
      scattering of sugar-plums in the teeth, of married and single, the blithe
      Reading was laughingly brought to its conclusion.

    <h2>
      BARBOX BROTHERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nobody but the writer of this little freak of fancy could possibly have
      rendered the Reading of it in public worthy even of toleration. Perhaps no
      Reading that could be selected presents within the same compass so many
      difficulties to the audience who are listening, and to the Reader who is
      hardy enough to adventure upon its delivery. The closing incidents of the
      narrative are in themselves so improbable, we had all but said so
      impossible! Polly, at once so quaint and so captivating, when her words
      are perused upon the printed page, is so incapable of having her
      baby-prattle repeated by anybody else, without the imminent risk, the all
      but certainty, of its degenerating into mere childishness. It can scarcely
      be wondered, therefore, that &ldquo;Barbox Brothers,&rdquo; though it actually was
      Read, and Read successfully, was hardly ever repeated. Everybody who has
      once looked into the story will bear in mind how, quite abruptly, almost
      haphazard, it comes to be narrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumbering, middle-aged, grey-headed hero of it, in obedience to the
      whim of a moment, gets out of a night train at the great central junction
      of the whole railway system of England. A drenching rain-storm and a windy
      platform, darkness and solitude are, to begin with, the agreeable
      surroundings of this eccentric traveller. He is stranded there, not high
      and dry, anything but that&mdash;on the contrary, soaked through and
      through, and at very low level indeed&mdash;during what the local
      officials regard as their deadest time in all the twenty-four hours: what
      one of them, later on, terms emphatically their deadest and buriedest
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already, even here, before the tale itself is in any way begun, the Author
      of it, in his capacity as Reader, somehow, by the mere manner of his
      delivery of a descriptive sentence or two, contrived to realise to his
      hearers in a wonderfully vivid way the strange incidents of the traffic in
      a scene like this, at those blackest intervals between midnight and
      daybreak. Now revealing&mdash;&ldquo;Mysterious goods trains, covered with
      palls, and gliding on like vast weird funerals, conveying themselves
      guiltily away, as if their freight had come to a secret and unlawful end.&rdquo;
       Now, again&mdash;&ldquo;Half miles of coal pursuing in a Detective manner,
      following when they led, stopping when they stopped, backing when they
      backed.&rdquo; One while the spectacle, conjured up by a word or two was that of&mdash;&ldquo;Unknown
      languages in the air, conspiring in red, green, and white characters.&rdquo;
       Another, with startling effect, it was&mdash;&ldquo;An earthquake, with thunder
      and lightning, going up express to London.&rdquo; Here it is that Barbox
      Brothers, in the midst of these ghostly apparitions, is eventually
      extricated from the melancholy plight in which he finds himself saturated
      and isolated in the middle of a spiderous web of railroads.
    </p>
    <p>
      His extricator is&mdash;Lamps! A worthy companion portrait to that of
      cinderous Mr. Toodles, the stoker, familiar to the readers of Dombey.
      Characters, those two, quite as typical, after their fashion, of the later
      railway period of Dickens, as even Sam Weller, the boots, and Old Weller,
      the coachman, were of his earlier coaching period in the days of Pickwick.
      To see him, in his capacity as Lamps, when excited, take what he called &ldquo;a
      rounder&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, giving himself, with his oily handkerchief
      rolled up in the form of a ball, &ldquo;an elaborate smear from behind the right
      ear, up the cheek, across the forehead, and down the other cheek, behind
      his left ear,&rdquo; after which operation he is described as having shone
      exceedingly&mdash;was to be with him, again, at once, in his greasy little
      cabin, which was suggestive to the sense of smell of a cabin in a whaler.
      How it came to pass that Lamps sang comic songs, of his own composition,
      to his bed-ridden daughter Phoebe, by way of enlivening her solitude, and
      how Phoebe, while manipulating the threads on her lace-pillow, as though
      she were playing a musical instrument, taught her little band of children
      to chant to a pleasant tune the multiplication-table, and so fix it and
      other useful knowledge indelibly upon the tablets of their memory, the
      Author-Reader would then relate, as no other Reader, however gifted, who
      was not also the Author, would have been allowed to do, supposing this
      latter had had the hardihood to attempt the relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Reading advanced, the difficulties not only increased, they became
      tenfold, immediately upon the introduction of Polly. Dickens, however,
      conquered them all somehow. But to anybody else, setting forth the story
      histrionically, impersonating the characters as they appeared, these
      difficulties would by necessity have been insuperable or simply
      overwhelming. Catching the very little fair-haired girl's Christian name
      readily enough, when she comes up to him in the street, with the
      surprising announcement, &ldquo;O! if you please, I am lost!&rdquo; Barbox Brothers
      can't for the life of him conjecture what her surname is,&mdash;carefully
      imitating, though he does, the sound that comes from the childish lips,
      each time on its repetition. Hazarding &ldquo;Trivits,&rdquo; first of all, then
      &ldquo;Paddens,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Tappi-tarver.&rdquo; Eventually, when the two arrive
      hand-in-hand at Barbox Brothers' hotel, nobody there could make out her
      name as she set it forth, &ldquo;except one chambermaid, who said it was
      Constantinople&mdash;which it wasn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No wonder Barbox feels bigger and heavier in person every minute when he
      is being catechised by Polly! Asked by her if he knows any stories, and
      compelled to answer, &ldquo;No! What a dunce you must be, mustn't you?&rdquo; says
      Polly. Frightened nearly out of his wits at the dinner-table, when they
      are feasting together, by her getting on her feet upon her chair to reward
      him with a kiss, and then toppling forward among the dishes&mdash;he
      himself crying out in dismay, &ldquo;Gracious angels! Whew! I thought we were in
      the fire, Polly!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What a coward you are, ain't you?&rdquo; says Polly,
      when replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the next morning, when brought down to breakfast, after a comfortable
      night's sleep, passed by the child in a bed shared with &ldquo;the
      Constantinopolitan chambermaid,&rdquo; Polly, &ldquo;by that time a mere heap of
      dimples,&rdquo; poses poor, unwieldy Barbox by asking him, in a wheedling
      manner, &ldquo;What are we going to do, you dear old thing?&rdquo; On his suggesting
      their having a sight, at the Circus, of two long-tailed ponies, speckled
      all over&mdash;&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; cries Polly, in an ecstasy. When he
      afterwards throws out a proposition that they shall also look in at the
      toy-shop, and choose a doll&mdash;&ldquo;Not dressed,&rdquo; ejaculates Polly; &ldquo;No,
      no, no&mdash;not dressed!&rdquo; Barbox replying, &ldquo;Full dressed; together with a
      house, and all things necessary for housekeeping!&rdquo; Polly gives a little
      scream, and seems in danger of falling into a swoon of bliss. &ldquo;What a
      darling you are!&rdquo; she languidly exclaims, leaning back in her chair: &ldquo;Come
      and be hugged.&rdquo; All this will indicate plainly enough the difficulties
      investing every sentence of this Reading, capped as they all are by the
      astounding <i>denouement</i> of the plot&mdash;Polly turning out to be
      (sly little thing!) the purposely-lost daughter of Barbox Brothers' old
      love, Beatrice, and of her husband, Tresham, for whom Barbox had not only
      been jilted, but by whom Barbox had been simultaneously and rather heavily
      defrauded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the pleasantest recollection of the whole Reading is, not Polly&mdash;the
      small puss turns out to be such a cunningly reticent little emissary&mdash;but
      her Doll, a &ldquo;lovely specimen of Circassian descent, possessing as much
      boldness of beauty as was reconcileable with extreme feebleness of mouth,&rdquo;
       and combining a sky-blue pelisse with rose-coloured satin trousers, and a
      black velvet hat, &ldquo;the latter seemingly founded on the portraits of the
      late Duchess of Kent.&rdquo; One is almost reconciled to Polly, however,&mdash;becoming
      oblivious for the moment of her connivance in her mother's secret device,
      and reminiscent only of her own unsophisticated mixture of prattle and
      impertinence&mdash;on learning, immediately after this elaborate
      description of the gorgeous doll of her choice, that &ldquo;the name of this
      distinguished foreigner was (on Polly's authority) Miss Melluka.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE BOY AT MUGBY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several <i>gamins</i> have been contributed to our literature by Dickens&mdash;quite
      as typical and quite as truthful in their way, each of them, as Hugo's
      Gavroche. There is Jo the poor crossing-sweeper. There is the immortal
      Dodger. There is his pal the facetious Charley Bates. And there is that
      delightful boy at the end of &ldquo;The Carol,&rdquo; who conveys such a world of
      wonder through his simple reply of &ldquo;Why, Christmas Day!&rdquo; The boy who is
      &ldquo;as big,&rdquo; he says himself, as the prize turkey, and who gets off at last
      quicker than a shot propelled by the steadiest hand at a trigger!
      Scattered up and down the Boz fictions, there are abundant specimens of a
      <i>genus</i> that, in one instance, is actually termed by the Humorist, &ldquo;a
      town-made little boy&rdquo;&mdash;this is in the memorable street scene where
      Squeers hooks Smike by the coat-collar with the handle of his umbrella. He
      is always especially great in his delineation of what one might call the
      human cock-sparrows of London. Kit, at the outset of his career, is
      another example; and Tom Scott yet another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sloppy carries us away into the suburbs, thereby taking us in a manner off
      the stones, and otherwise represents in his own proper person, buttons and
      all, less one of the dapper urchins we are now more particularly referring
      to, than the shambling hobbledehoy. Even in the unfinished story with
      which the Author's voluminous writings were closed, there was portrayed an
      entirely novel specimen, one marked by the most grotesque extravagance, in
      the shape of that impish malignant, &ldquo;the Deputy,&rdquo; whose pastime at once
      and whole duty in life seemed to be making a sort of vesper cock-shy of
      Durdles and his dinner-bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conspicuous among these comic boys of Dickens may be remembered one who,
      instead of being introduced in any of the Novelist's larger works, from
      the Pickwick Papers clown to Edwin Drood, interpolates himself, as may be
      said, among one of the groups of Christmas stories, through the medium of
      a shrill monologue. &ldquo;The Boy at Mugby,&rdquo; to wit, the one exhilarated and
      exhilarating appreciate of the whole elaborate system of Refreshmenting in
      this Isle of the Brave and Land of the Free, by which he means to say
      Britannia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laconically, &ldquo;I am the Boy at Mugby,&rdquo; he announces. &ldquo;That's about what <i>I</i>
      am.&rdquo; His exact location he describes almost with the precision of one
      giving latitude and longitude&mdash;explaining to a nicety where his stand
      is taken. &ldquo;Up in a corner of the Down Refreshment Room at Mugby Junction,&rdquo;
       in the height of twenty-seven draughts [he's counted 'em, he tells us
      parenthetically, as they brush the First Class, hair twenty-seven ways],
      bounded on the nor'-west by the beer, and so on. He himself, he frankly
      informs you&mdash;in the event of your ever presenting yourself there
      before him at the counter, in quest of nourishment of any kind, either
      liquid or solid&mdash;will seem not to hear you, and will appear &ldquo;in a
      absent manner to survey the Line through a transparent medium composed of
      your head and body,&rdquo; determined evidently not to serve you, that is, as
      long as you can possibly bear it! &ldquo;That's me!&rdquo; cries the Boy at Mugby,
      exultantly,&mdash;adding, with an intense relish for his occupation, &ldquo;what
      a delightful lark it is!&rdquo; As for the eatables and drinkables habitually
      set forth upon the counter, by what he generally speaks of as the
      Refreshmenters, quoth the Boy at Mugby, in a <i>naif</i> confidence,
      addressed to you in your capacity at once as applicant and victim, &ldquo;when
      you're telegraphed, you should see 'em begin to pitch the stale pastry
      into the plates, and chuck the sawdust sang-wiches under the glass covers,
      and get out the&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;the sherry&mdash;O, my eye, my eye!&mdash;for
      your refreshment.&rdquo; Once or twice in a way only, &ldquo;The Boy at Mugby&rdquo; was
      introduced among the Readings, and then merely as a slight stop-gap or
      interlude. Thoroughly enjoying the delivery of it himself, and always
      provoking shouts of laughter whenever this colloquial morsel was given,
      the Novelist seemed to be perfectly conscious himself that it was
      altogether too slight and trivial of its kind, to be worthy of anything
      like artistic consideration; that it was an &ldquo;airy nothing&rdquo; in its way, to
      which it was scarcely deserving that he should give more than name and
      local habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critically regarded, it had its inconsistencies too, both as a writing and
      as a Reading. There was altogether too much precocity for a genuine boy,
      in the nice discrimination with which the Boy at Mugby hit off the
      contrasting nationalities. The foreigner, for example, who politely, hat
      in hand, &ldquo;beseeched Our Young Ladies, and our Missis,&rdquo; for a &ldquo;leetel gloss
      hoif prarndee,&rdquo; and who, after being repelled, on trying to help himself,
      exclaims, &ldquo;with hands clasped and shoulders riz: 'Ah! is it possible this;
      that these disdaineous females are placed here by the administration, not
      only to empoisen the voyagers, but to affront them! Great Heaven! How
      arrives it? The English people. Or is he then a slave? Or idiot?'&rdquo; Hardly
      would a veritable boy, even an urchin so well &ldquo;to the fore&rdquo; with his
      epoch, as the Boy at Mugby, depict so accurately, much less take off, with
      a manner so entirely life-like, the astounded foreigner, any more than he
      would the thoroughly wide-awake and gaily derisive American. The latter he
      describes as alternately trying and spitting out first the sawdust and
      then the&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;the sherry, until finally, on paying for both
      and consuming neither, he says, very loud, to Our Missis, and very good
      tempered, &ldquo;I tell Yew what 'tis ma'arm. I la'af. Theer! I la'af, I Dew. I
      oughter ha' seen most things, for I hail from the unlimited side of the
      Atlantic Ocean, and I haive travelled right slick over the Limited, head
      on, through Jeerusalem and the East, and likeways France and Italy,
      Europe, Old World, and I am now upon the track to the Chief European
      Village; but such an Institution as Yew and Yewer fixins, solid <i>and</i>
      liquid, afore the glorious Tarnal I never did see yet! And if I hain't
      found the eighth wonder of Monarchical Creation, in finding Yew and Yewer
      fixins, solid and liquid, in a country where the people air not absolute
      Loo-naticks, I am Extra Double Darned with a nip and frizzle to the
      innermost grit! Wheerfore&mdash;Theer!&mdash;I la'af! I Dew, ma'arm. I
      la'af!&rdquo; A calotype, or rather, literally, a speaking likeness, so true to
      the life as that, would be a trifle, we take it, beyond the mimetic powers
      and the keenly observant faculties even of a Boy whose senses had been
      wakened up by the twenty-seven cross draughts of the Refreshment Room at
      Mugby.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the fun made of the bandolining by Our Young Ladies, and of Our
      Missis's lecture on Foreign Refreshmenting, and of Sniff's corkscrew and
      his servile disposition, it is intentionally fooling, no doubt, but it is&mdash;excellent
      fooling! As was admirably said in the number of <i>Macmillan</i> for
      January, 1871, by the anonymous writer of a Reminiscence of the Amateur
      Theatricals at Tavistock House,&mdash;the remark following immediately
      after Charles Dickens's version of the Ghost's Song in Henry Fielding's
      burlesque of Tom Thumb,&mdash;&ldquo;Nonsense, it may be said, all this; but the
      nonsense of a great genius has always something of genius in it.&rdquo; Had not
      Swift his &ldquo;little language&rdquo; to Stella, to &ldquo;Stellakins,&rdquo; to &ldquo;roguish,
      impudent, pretty M. D.?&rdquo; Than some of which little language, quoth
      Thackeray, in commenting upon it, &ldquo;I know of nothing more manly, more
      tender, more exquisitely touching.&rdquo; Again, had not Pope, in conjunction
      with the Dean, his occasional unbending also as a <i>farceur</i>, in the
      wilder freaks and oddities of Martinus Scriblerus? So was it here with one
      who was beyond all doubt, more intensely a Humorist than either, when he
      wrote or read such harmless sarcasms and innocent whimsicalities, as those
      alternately underlying, and overlaying the boyish fun of this juvenile
      Refreshmenter at Mugby Junction.

    <h2>
      DOCTOR MARIGOLD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Already mention has been made of the extraordinary care lavished, as a
      general rule, by the Novelist upon the preparation of these Readings
      before they were, each in turn, submitted for the first time to public
      scrutiny. A strikingly illustrative instance of this may be here
      particularised. It occurred upon the occasion of a purely experimental
      Reading of &ldquo;Doctor Marigold,&rdquo; which came off privately, on the evening of
      the 18th of March, 1866, in the drawing-room of Charles Dickens's then
      town residence, in Southwick Place, Tyburnia. Including, among those
      present, the members of his own home circle, his entire audience numbered
      no more than ten persons altogether. Four, at any rate, of that party may
      be here identified, each of whom doubtless still bears the occasion
      referred to vividly in his remembrance,&mdash;Robert Browning the poet,
      Charles Fechter the actor, Wilkie Collins the novelist, and John Forster
      the historian of the Commonwealth. Even in private, Dickens had never Read
      &ldquo;Doctor Marigold&rdquo; until that evening. Often as he Read it afterwards, he
      never Read it with a more contagious air of exhilaration. He hardly ever,
      in fact, gave one of his almost wholly comic and but incidentally pathetic
      Readings <i>so</i> effectively. In every sentence there was a zest or
      relish that was irresistible. The volubility of the &ldquo;poor chap in the
      sleeved-waistcoat&rdquo; sped the Reading on with a rapidity quite beyond
      anticipation, when the time, which had been carefully marked at the
      commencement of the Reading, came to be notified at its conclusion. That
      the merest first rehearsal should have run off thus glibly seemed just
      simply incomprehensible. With the sense of this surprise still fresh upon
      us, the tentative Reading being at the time only a few seconds completed,
      everything was explained, however, by a half-whispered remark made, to the
      present writer, in passing, by the Novelist&mdash;made by him
      half-weariedly, yet half-laughingly&mdash;&ldquo;There! If I have gone through
      that already to myself once, I have gone through it two&mdash;hundred&mdash;times!&rdquo;
       It was not lightly or carelessly therefore, as may now be seen, that
      Charles Dickens, in his later capacity&mdash;not pen-in-hand, or through
      green monthly numbers, but standing at a reading-desk upon a public
      platform&mdash;undertook the office of a popular entertainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved throughout his career as a Reader to acquit himself of those
      newly-assumed responsibilities to the utmost of his powers, to the fullest
      extent of his capabilities, both physical and intellectual, he applied his
      energies to the task, with a zeal that, it is impossible not to recognise
      now, amounted in the end to nothing less than (literally) self-sacrifice.
      But for the devotion of his energies thus unstintingly to the laborious
      task upon which he had adventured&mdash;a task involving in its
      accomplishment an enormous amount of rapid travelling by railway, keeping
      him for months together, besides, in one ceaseless whirl of bodily and
      mental excitement&mdash;his splendid constitution, sustained and
      strengthened as it was by his wholesome enjoyment of out-of-door life, and
      his habitual indulgence in bathing and pedes-trianism, gave him every
      reasonable hope of reaching the age of an octogenarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bearing in mind in addition to the wear-and-tear of the Readings in
      England and America, the nervous shock of that terrible railway accident
      at Staplehurst, on the 9th of June, 1865, the lamentable catastrophe of
      exactly five years afterwards to the very day, that of the 9th of June,
      1870, becomes readily comprehensible. Because of his absorption in his
      task, however, all through, he was unconscious for the most part of the
      wasting influence of his labours, or, if he was so at all towards the
      close of his career, he was so, even then, only fitfully and at the rarest
      intervals. Precisely in the same way, it may be remarked, in regard to
      those who watched his whole course as a Reader, that so facile and so
      pleasureable to himself, as well as to them, appeared to be the novel
      avocation which had come of late years to be alternated with his more
      accustomed toil as an author, that it rendered even the most observant
      amongst them unconscious in their turn of the disastrously exhausting
      influence of this unnatural blending together of two professions. A
      remorseful sense of this comes back upon us now, when it is all too late,
      in our remembrance of that remark made by the Novelist immediately after
      the Private Reading of &ldquo;Doctor Marigold,&rdquo; a remark then regarded as simply
      curious and interesting, but now having about it an almost painful
      significance. Never was work more thoroughly or more conscientiously done,
      from first to last, than in the instance of these Readings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the minute elaboration of the care with which they were prepared, in
      the vivacity with which they were one and all of them delivered, in the
      punctuality with which, whirled like a shuttle in a loom, to and fro,
      hither and thither, through all parts of the United Kingdom and of the
      United States, the Reader kept, link by link, an immensely-lengthened
      chain of appointments, until the first link was broken suddenly at Preston&mdash;one
      can recognise at length the full force of those simple words uttered by
      him upon the occasion of his Farewell Reading, where he spoke of himself
      as &ldquo;a faithful servant of the public, always imbued with a sense of duty
      to them, and always striving to do his best.&rdquo; Among the many radiant
      illustrations that have been preserved of how thoroughly he did his best,
      not the least brilliant in its way was this eminently characteristic
      Reading of &ldquo;Doctor Mari-gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All through it, from the very beginning down to the very end of his
      Confidences, the Cheap Jack, in his belcher neckcloth and his
      sleeved-waistcoat with the mother-o'-pearl buttons, was there talking to
      us, as only he could talk to us, from the foot-board of his cart. He
      remained thus before us from his first mention of his own father having
      always consistently called himself Willum to the moment when little Sophy&mdash;the
      third little Sophy&mdash;comes clambering up the steps, and reveals that
      she at least is not deaf and dumb by crying out to him, &ldquo;Grandfather!&rdquo; As
      for the patter of Doctor Marigold, it is among the humorous revelations of
      imaginative literature. Hear him when he is perhaps the best worth
      listening to, when he is in his true rostrum, when his bluchers are on his
      native foot-board, and his name is, more intensely than ever, Doctor
      Marigold! Don't we all remember him there, for example, on a Saturday
      night in the market-place&mdash;&ldquo;Here's a pair of razors that'll shave you
      closer than the board of guardians; here's a flat-iron worth its weight in
      gold; here's a frying-pan artificially flavoured with essence of
      beefsteaks to that degree that you've only got for the rest of your lives
      to fry bread and dripping in it and there you are replete with animal
      food; here's a genuine chronometer-watch, in such a solid silver case that
      you may knock at the door with it when you come home late from a social
      meeting, and rouse your wife and family and save up your knocker for the
      postman; and here's half a dozen dinner-plates that you may play the
      cymbals with to charm the baby when it's fractious. Stop! I'll throw you
      in another article, and I'll give you that, and it's a rolling-pin; and if
      the baby can only get it well into it's mouth when its teeth is coming,
      and rub the gums once with it, they'll come through double in a fit of
      laughter equal to being tickled.&rdquo; And so on, ringing the changes on a
      thousand wonderful conceits and whimsicalities that come tumbling out one
      after another in inexhaustible sequence and with uninterrupted volubility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very Prince of Cheap Jacks, surely, is this Doctor Marigold! And, more
      than that, one who makes good his claim to the title of wit, humorist,
      satirist, philanthropist, and philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his philosophic contentment, what can equal that as implied in his
      summing up of his own humble surroundings? &ldquo;A roomy cart, with the large
      goods hung outside, and the bed slung underneath it when on the road; an
      iron-pot and a kettle, a fireplace for the cold weather, a chimney for the
      smoke, a hanging-shelf and a cupboard, a dog and a horse. What more do you
      want? You draw off on a bit of turf in a green lane or by the roadside,
      you hobble your old horse and turn him grazing, you light your fire upon
      the ashes of the last visitors, you cook your stew, and you wouldn't call
      the Emperor of France your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for his wit, hear him describe&mdash;&ldquo;What? Why, I'll tell you! It's
      made of fine gold, and it's not broke, though there's a hole in the middle
      of it, and it's stronger than any fetter that was ever forged. What else
      is it? I'll tell you. It's a hoop of solid gold wrapped in a silver
      curl-paper that I myself took off the shining locks of the ever-beautiful
      old lady in Threadneedle Street, London city. I wouldn't tell you so, if I
      hadn't the paper to show, or you mightn't believe it even of me. Now, what
      else is it? It's a man-trap, and a hand-cuff, the parish stocks and a
      leg-lock, all in gold and all in one. Now, what else is it? It's a
      wedding-ring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for something far better than any mere taste of his skill as a
      satirist, see the whole of his delectable take off&mdash;in
      contradistinction to himself, the itinerant Cheap Jack&mdash;of the
      political Dear Jack in the public marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his philanthropy, it is unobtrusively proclaimed by the drift of
      his whole narrative, and especially by two or three among the more
      remarkable of its closing incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his powers as a humorist, they may be found there <i>passim</i>,
      being scattered broadcast all through his autobiographic recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those recollections are we not indebted for a whole gallery of
      inimitable delineations? The Cheap Jack's very dog, for instance, who had
      taught himself out of his own head to growl at any person in the crowd
      that bid as low as sixpence! Or Pickleson the giant, with a little head
      and less in it. Of whom, observes Doctor Marigold, &ldquo;He was a languid young
      man, which I attribute to the distance betwixt his extremities.&rdquo; About
      whom, when a sixpence is given to him by Doctor Marigold, the latter
      remarks in a preposterous parenthesis, &ldquo;(for he was kept as short as he
      was long!)&rdquo; As for Dickens's high falsetto, when speaking in the person of
      this same Pickleson, with a voice that, as Doctor Marigold says, seemed to
      come from his eyebrows, it was only just a shade more excruciatingly
      ridiculous than his guttural and growling objurgations in the character of
      the giant's proprietor, the fe-rocious Mim.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his modest appetite for the simpler pleasures of existence,
      Doctor Marigold betrays in one instance, by the way, the taste of a <i>gourmet</i>.
      &ldquo;I knocked up a beefsteak-pudding for one,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;with two kidneys, a
      dozen oysters, and a couple of mushrooms thrown in:&rdquo; adding, with a fine
      touch of nature drawn from experience, &ldquo;It's a pudding to put a man in
      good humour with everything, except the two bottom buttons of his
      waistcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Incomparably the finest portion of all this wonderfully original sketch of
      Doctor Marigold, both in the Writing and in the Reading, was that in which
      the poor Cheap Jack is represented as going through his customary patter
      on the foot-board with his poor little Sophy&mdash;the first of the three
      Sophies, his own by birth, and not simply by adoption&mdash;the while she
      is slowly dying on his shoulder. Thackeray was right when he said of the
      humour of Dickens, &ldquo;It is a mixture of love and wit.&rdquo; Laughter and tears,
      with him, lay very near&mdash;speaking of him as an author, we may say by
      preference&mdash;lie very near indeed together. It is in those passages in
      which they come in astonishingly rapid alternation, and at moments almost
      simultaneously, that he is invariably at his very best. The incident here
      alluded to is one of these more exquisite descriptions, and it was one,
      that, by voice and look and manner, he himself most exquisitely
      delineated. When the poor Cheap Jack, with Sophy holding round his neck,
      steps out from the shelter of the cart upon the foot-board, and the
      waiting crowd all set up a laugh on seeing them&mdash;&ldquo;one chuckle-headed
      Joskin (that I hated for it) making a bid 'tuppence for her!'&rdquo;&mdash;Doctor
      Marigold begins his tragi-comic allocution. It is sown thickly all through
      with the most whimsical of his conceits, but it is interrupted also here
      and there with infinitely pathetic touches of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fragmentary illustrations of either would but dimly shadow forth, instead
      of clearly elucidating, what is here meant in the recollection of those
      who can still recall this Reading of &ldquo;Doctor Marigold&rdquo; to their
      remembrance. Those who never heard it as it actually fell from the
      Author's lips, by turning to the original sketch, and running through that
      particular portion of it to themselves, may more readily conjecture than
      by the aid of mere piecemeal quotation, all that the writer of those riant
      and tearful pages would be capable of accomplishing by its utterance,
      bringing to its delivery, as he could, so many of the rarer gifts of
      genius, and so many also of the rarest accomplishments of art.

    <h2>
      SIKES AND NANCY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Saturday, the 14th of November, 1868, there were assembled together in
      front of the great platform in St. James's Hall, Piccadilly, as fit
      audience, but few, somewhere about fifty of the critics, artists, and
      literary men of London. A card of invitation, stamped with a facsimile of
      the well-known autograph of Charles Dickens, and countersigned by the
      Messrs. Chappell and Company, had, with a witty significance, bidden them
      to that rendezvous for a &ldquo;Private Trial of the Murder in Oliver Twist.&rdquo;
       The occasion, in point of fact, was a sort of experimental rehearsal of
      the last and most daring of all these vividly dramatic Readings by the
      popular Novelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious himself that there was a certain amount of audacity in his
      adventuring thus upon a delineation so really startling in its character,
      he was not unnaturally desirous of testing its fitness for representation
      before the public, first of all in the presence of those who were probably
      the best qualified to pronounce a perfectly dispassionate opinion. It
      certainly appeared somewhat dubious at the first, that question as to the
      suitability for portrayal before mixed assemblages, of one of the most
      powerfully tragic incidents ever depicted by him in the whole range of his
      voluminous contributions to imaginative literature. The passages selected
      to this end from his famous story of Oliver Twist were those relating more
      particularly to the Murder of Nancy by Bill Sikes. A ghastlier atrocity
      than that murder could hardly be imagined. In the book itself, as will be
      remembered, the crime is painted as with a brush dipped in blood rather
      than pigment. The infamous deed is there described in language worthy of
      one of the greatest realists in fictitious narrative. Henri de Balzac,
      even in his more sanguinary imaginings, never showed a completer mastery
      of the horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering all this, and feeling perfectly assured at the same time, that
      the scene then about to be depicted by the Author in person, would most
      certainly lose nothing of its terror in the representation, the
      acknowledgment may here be made by the writer of these pages, that, on
      entering the Hall that evening, he was in considerable doubt as to what
      might be the result of the experiment. Compared with the size of the
      enormous building, the group of those assembled appeared to be the merest
      handful of an audience clustered together towards the front immediately
      below the platform of the orchestra. Standing at the back of this group,
      the writer recalls to mind, in regard to that evening, a circumstance
      plainly enough indicating how fully his own unexpressed uncertainty was
      akin to that of the Author-Reader himself. The circumstance, namely, that
      Charles Dickens, immediately on entering the hall, before taking his place
      at his reading-desk upon the platform, came round, and after exchanging a
      few words with him, uttered this earnest Aside,&mdash;&ldquo;I want you to watch
      this particularly, for I am very doubtful about it myself!&rdquo; Before that
      Experimental Reading was half over, however, all doubt upon the matter was
      utterly dissipated. In the powerful effect of it, the murder-scene
      immeasurably surpassed anything he had ever achieved before as an
      impersonator of his own creations. In its climax, it was as splendid a
      piece of tragic acting as had for many years been witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, in effect, was Macready's comment upon it some months afterwards,
      when, with an especial eye to the great tragedian's opinion, &ldquo;Sikes and
      Nancy&rdquo; was given at Cheltenham? It was laconic enough, but it afforded a
      world of pleasure to the Author-Actor when his old friend&mdash;himself
      the hero of so many tragic triumphs&mdash;summed up his estimate, by
      saying, characteristically, &ldquo;Two Macbeths!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four of the imaginary beings of the novel were introduced, or, it should
      rather be said, were severally produced before us as actual embodiments.
      Occasionally, during one of the earlier scenes, it is true that the gentle
      voice of Rose Maylie was audible, while a few impressive words were spoken
      there also at intervals by Mr. Brownlow. But, otherwise, the interlocutors
      were four, and four only: to wit&mdash;Nancy, Bill Sikes, Morris Bolter,
      otherwise Noah Claypole, and the Jew Fagin. Than those same characters no
      four perhaps in the whole range of fiction could be more widely
      contrasted. Yet, widely contrasted, utterly dissimilar, though they are,
      in themselves, the extraordinary histrionic powers of their creator,
      enabled him to present them to view, with a rapidity of sequence or
      alternation, so astonishing in its mingled facility and precision, that
      the characters themselves seemed not only to be before us in the flesh,
      but sometimes one might almost have said were there simultaneously. Each
      in turn as portrayed hy him&mdash;meaning portrayed hy him not simply in
      the hook hut hy himself in person&mdash;was in its way a finished
      masterpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the Author as he himself embodied these creations&mdash;Fagin,
      the Jew, was there completely, audibly, visibly before us, by a sort of
      transformation! Here, in effect&mdash;as several years previously in the
      midst of his impersonation of Wilmot in Lord Lytton's comedy of Not so Bad
      as we Seem, namely, where, in the garret, the young patrician affects for
      a while to be Edmund Curll the bookseller&mdash;the impersonator's very
      stature, each time Fagin opened his lips, seemed to be changed
      instantaneously. Whenever he spoke, there started before us&mdash;high-shouldered,
      with contracted chest, with birdlike claws, eagerly anticipating hy their
      every movement the passionate words fiercely struggling for utterance at
      his lips&mdash;that most villainous old tutor of young thieves, receiver
      of stolen goods, and very devil incarnate: his features distorted with
      rage, his penthouse eyebrows (those wonderful eyebrows!) working like the
      antennæ of some deadly reptile, his whole aspect, half-vulpine,
      half-vulture-like, in its hungry wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever <i>he</i> spoke, again, Morris Bolter&mdash;quite as instantly,
      just as visibly and as audibly&mdash;was there upon the platform.
      Listening to him, though we were all of us perfectly conscious of doing,
      through the Protean voice, and looking at him through the variable
      features of the Novelist, we somehow saw, no longer the Novelist, but&mdash;each
      time Noah Clay-pole said a word&mdash;that chuckle-headed, long-limbed,
      clownish, sneaking varlet, who is the spy on Nancy, the tool of Fagin, and
      the secret evil-genius of Sikes, hounding the latter on, as he does,
      unwittingly, to the dreadful deed of homicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Author's embodiment of Sikes&mdash;the burly ruffian with thews
      of iron and voice of Stentor&mdash;it was only necessary to hear that
      infuriated voice, and watch the appalling blows dealt by his imaginary
      bludgeon in the perpetration of the crime, to realise the force, the
      power, the passion, informing the creative mind of the Novelist at once in
      the original conception of the character, and then, so many years
      afterwards, in its equally astonishing representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the portrayal of Nancy, however, that the genius of the
      Author-Actor found the opportunity, beyond all others, for its most signal
      manifestation. Only that the catastrophe was in itself, by necessity so
      utterly revolting, there would have been something exquisitely pathetic in
      many parts of that affecting delineation. The character was revealed with
      perfect consistency throughout&mdash;from the scene of suppressed emotion
      upon the steps of London Bridge, when she is scared with the eltrich
      horror of her forebodings, down to her last gasping, shrieking
      apostrophes, to &ldquo;Bill, clear Bill,&rdquo; when she sinks, blinded by blood,
      under the murderous blows dealt upon her upturned face by her brutal
      paramour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, the horror experienced by the assassin afterwards! So far as
      it went, it was as grand a reprehension of all murderers as hand could
      well have penned or tongue have uttered. It had about it something of the
      articulation of an avenging voice not against Sikes only, but against all
      who ever outraged, or ever dreamt of outraging, the sanctity of human
      life. And it was precisely this which tended to sublimate an incident
      otherwise of the ghastliest horror into a homily of burning eloquence, the
      recollection of which among those who once saw it revealed through the
      lips, the eyes, the whole aspect of Charles Dickens will not easily be
      obliterated. The moral drawn from it&mdash;and there was this moral
      interpenetrating or impregnating the whole&mdash;became appreciable, it
      might even have been by Sikes himself, from the first moment the ruffian
      realised that the crime had been actually accomplished. It spoke
      trumpet-tongued from the very instant when he recoiled from &ldquo;it!&rdquo; Nancy no
      more, but thenceforth flesh and blood&mdash;&ldquo;But such flesh, and so much
      blood!&rdquo; Nevertheless, in that Experimental Reading of the 14th of
      November, 1868, the effect of all this appeared, in the estimation of the
      present writer, to have been in a great measure marred by the abruptness
      with which, almost the instant after the crime had been committed, the
      Reading was terminated. Sikes burnt upon the hearth the blood-stained
      weapon with which the murder had been perpetrated&mdash;-was startled for
      a moment by the hair upon the end of the club shrinking to a light cinder
      and whirling up the chimney&mdash;and then, dragging the dog (whose very
      feet were bloody) after him, and locking the door, left the house. There,
      the Experimental Reading abruptly terminated. It seemed not only
      insufficient, but a lost opportunity. Insomuch, that the writer, on the
      following day, remonstrated with the Novelist as earnestly as possible,
      urging him to append to the Reading as it then stood some fragmentary
      portion, at least, of the chapter descriptive of the flight, so that the
      remorseful horror of Sikes might be more fully realised. Of the
      reasonableness of this objection, however, Dickens himself was so wholly
      unconvinced, that, in the midst of his arguments against it, he wrote, in
      a tone of good-humoured indignation, &ldquo;My dear fellow, believe me that no
      audience on earth could be held for ten minutes after the girl's death.
      Give them time, and they would be revengeful for having had such a strain
      put upon them. Trust me to be right. I stand there, and I know.&rdquo; Than this
      nothing could very well have been more strongly expressed, as indicative
      of the conclusion at which he had deliberately arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      So frankly open to conviction was he, nevertheless, that, not disdaining
      to defer to the judgment of another when his own had been convinced, the
      Reading was eventually, after all, lengthened out by a very remarkable
      addition. The printed copy of this fragment of Oliver Twist, artistically
      compacted together as &ldquo;A Reading,&rdquo; has, appended to it, in blue ink, three
      pages of manuscript in the Novelist's familiar handwriting, in which, with
      a cunning mastery of all the powers of condensation, he has compacted
      together in a few sentences what he always gave with wonderful effect
      before the public, the salient incidents of the murderer's flight, ending
      with his own destruction, and even his dog's, from the housetop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing that could most powerfully realise to the audience the ruffian's
      sense of horror and abhorrence has been there overlooked. The ghastly
      figure follows him everywhere. He hears its garments rustling in the
      leaves. &ldquo;If <i>he</i> stopped, <i>it</i> stopped. If <i>he</i> ran, <i>it</i>
      followed.&rdquo; Turning at times to beat the phantom off, though it should
      strike him dead, the hair rises on his head, and his blood stands still,
      for it has turned with him and is behind him! Throwing himself on his back
      upon the road&mdash;&ldquo;At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still: a
      human gravestone with its epitaph in Blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What is as striking as anything in all this Reading, however&mdash;that
      is, in the Reading copy of it now lying before us as we write&mdash;is the
      mass of hints as to byplay in the stage directions for himself, so to
      speak, scattered up and down the margin. &ldquo;Fagin raised his right hand, and
      shook his trembling forefinger in the air,&rdquo; is there, on p. 101, in print.
      Beside it, on the margin in MS., is the word &ldquo;Action.&rdquo; Not a word of it
      was said. It was simply <i>done</i>. Again, immediately below that on the
      same page&mdash;Sikes' loquitur&mdash;&ldquo;'Oh! you haven't, haven't you?'
      passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket ['Action,' again, in MS. on
      the margin.]' That's lucky for one of us&mdash;which one that is don't
      matter.'&rdquo; Not a word was said about the pistol&mdash;the marginal
      direction was simply attended to. On the opposite page, in print, &ldquo;Fagin
      laid his hand upon the bundle, and locked it in the cupboard. But he did
      not take his eyes off the robber for an instant.&rdquo; On the margin in MS.,
      oddly but significantly underlined, are the words, &ldquo;Cupboard Action.&rdquo; So
      again afterwards, as a rousing self-direction, one sees notified in
      manuscript, on p. 107, the grim stage direction, &ldquo;Murder Coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As certainly as the &ldquo;Trial from Pickwick&rdquo; was the most laughter-moving of
      all the Readings, and as the &ldquo;Story of Little Dombey,&rdquo; again, was the most
      pathetic, &ldquo;Sikes and Nancy&rdquo; was in all respects the most powerfully
      dramatic and, in the grand tragic force of it, in many ways, the most
      impressive and remarkable.

    <h2>
      THE FAREWELL READING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In recording the incident of his Farewell Reading, there comes back to us
      a yet later recollection of the great Novelist; and illustrating, as it
      does, his passionate love for the dramatic art, it may here be mentioned
      not inappropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
      It relates simply to a remark suddenly made by him&mdash;and which had
      been suggested, so far as we can remember, by nothing we had been talking
      about previously&mdash;towards the close of our very last suburban walk
      together. Going round by way of Lambeth one afternoon in the early summer
      of 1870, we had skirted the Thames along the Surrey bank, had crossed the
      river higher up, and on our way back were returning at our leisure through
      Westminster; when, just as we were approaching the shadow of the old Abbey
      at Poet's Corner, under the roof-beams of which he was so soon to be laid
      in his grave, with a rain of tears and flowers, he abruptly asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think would be the realisation of one of my most cherished
      day-dreams?&rdquo; Adding, instantly, without waiting for airy answer, &ldquo;To
      settle down now for the remainder of my life within easy distance of a
      great theatre, in the direction of which I should hold supreme authority.
      It should be a house, of course, having a skilled and noble company, and
      one in every way magnificently appointed. The pieces acted should be dealt
      with according to my pleasure, and touched up here and there in obedience
      to my own judgment; the players as well as the plays being absolutely
      under my command. There,&rdquo; said he, laughingly, and in a glow at the mere
      fancy, &ldquo;<i>that's</i> my daydream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dickens's delighted enjoyment, in fact, of everything in any way connected
      with the theatrical profession, was second only to that shown by him in
      the indulgence of the master-passion of his life, his love of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way in which he threw himself into his labours, as a Reader, was only
      another indication of his intense affection for the dramatic art. For, as
      we have already insisted, the Readings were more than simply Readings,
      they were in the fullest meaning of the words singularly ingenious and
      highly elaborated histrionic performances. And his sustained success in
      them during fifteen years altogether, and, as we have seen, through as
      many as five hundred representations, may be accounted for in the same way
      as his still more prolonged success, from the beginning of his career as a
      Novelist down to its very close, from the Pickwick Papers to Edwin Drood,
      otherwise, during an interval of four-and-thirty consecutive years, as the
      most popular author of his generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret of his original success, and of the long sustamment of it in
      each of these two careers&mdash;as Writer and as Reader&mdash;is in a
      great measure discoverable in this, that whatever powers he possessed he
      applied to their very uttermost. Whether as Author or as Impersonator, he
      gave himself up to his appointed task, not partially or intermittingly,
      but thoroughly and indefatigably.
    </p>
    <p>
      His rule in life, in this way, he has himself clearly explained in the
      forty-second chapter of David Copperfield. What he there says about
      David's industry and perseverance, applies as directly to himself, as what
      he also relates in regard to his young hero's earlier toils as a
      parliamentary reporter, and his precocious fame as a writer of fiction.
      Speaking at once for David and for himself, he there writes for both or
      for either, &ldquo;Whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my
      heart to do well; whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself
      to completely; in great aims and in small I have always been thoroughly in
      earnest. I have never believed it possible that any natural or improved
      ability can claim immunity from the companionship of the steady, plain,
      hard-working qualities, and hope to gain its end. There is no substitute
      for thorough-going, ardent, and sincere earnestness. Never to put one hand
      to anything on which I could throw my whole self; and never to affect
      depreciation of my work, whatever it was, I find now to have been my
      golden rules.&rdquo; What is there said applies far more recognisably to the
      real Charles Dickens than to the imaginary David Copperfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attestations of the truth of this were discoverable, at every turn, in
      regard to his regular system, his constant method, nay, his minutest
      tricks of habit, so to speak, both as Reader and as Novelist. It was so
      when as an Author, for example, note was taken, now of his careful
      forecast of a serial tale on as many slips as there were to be green
      monthly numbers; now of his elaborately corrected and recorrected
      manuscripts; now of the proof-sheets lying about, for revision at any and
      every spare moment, during the month immediately before publication. Or,
      when, on the other hand, in his capacity as a Reader, regard was had to
      the scrupulous exactitude with which the seemingly trivial minutiae of
      what one might call the mere accompaniments, were systematically cared for
      or methodised. Announced to read, for instance, for the first time in some
      town he had never before visited for that purpose, or in some building in
      which his voice had never before been raised, he would go down to the
      empty hall long before the hour appointed for the Reading, to take the
      bearings, as he would say, or, in other words, to familiarise himself with
      the place beforehand. His interest in his audience, again, was something
      delightful. He was hardly less keenly observant of them than they of him.
      Through a hole in the curtain at the side, or through a chink in the
      screen upon the platform, he would eagerly direct your attention to what
      never palled upon his own, namely, the effect of the suddenly brightened
      sea of faces on the turning up of the gas, immediately before the moment
      of his own appearance at the reading-desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening at length came for his very last appearance at that familiar
      little reading-desk, on Tuesday, the 15th of March, 1870, on the platform
      of the St. James's Hall, Piccadilly. The largest audience ever assembled
      in that immense building, the largest, as already intimated, that ever can
      be assembled there for purely Reading purposes, namely, when the orchestra
      and the upper end of the two side-galleries have necessarily to be barred
      or curtained off from the auditorium, were collected together there under
      the radiant pendants of the glittering ceiling, every available nook and
      corner, and all the ordinary gangways of the Great Hall being completely
      occupied. The money value of the house that night was £422. Crowds were
      unable to obtain admittance at the entrances in the Quadrant and in
      Piccadilly, long before the hour fixed for the Farewell Reading. Inside
      the building 2034 persons were seated there, eagerly awaiting the
      Novelist's appearance. The enthusiasm of his reception when eight o'clock
      came, and he advanced to the centre of the platform, of itself told
      plainly enough, as plainly as the printed hills announcing the fact in
      red, back, and yellow, that it was his last appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Readings selected were, as the very best that could have been chosen,
      his own favourites&mdash;&ldquo;The Christmas Carol,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Trial from
      Pickwick.&rdquo; He never read better in his life than he did on that last
      evening. Evidently enough, he was nerved to a crowning effort. And by
      sympathy his audience&mdash;his last audience&mdash;responded to him
      throughout by their instant and intense appreciation. Not a point was
      lost. Every good thing told to the echo, that is, through the echoing
      laughter. Scrooge, Fezziwig, the Fiddler, Topper, every one of the
      Cratchits, everybody in &ldquo;The Carol,&rdquo; including the Small Boy who is so
      great at repartee, all were welcomed in turn, as became them, with better
      than acclamations. It was the same exactly with the &ldquo;Trial from Pickwick&rdquo;&mdash;Justice
      Stareleigh, Serjeant Buzfuz, Mr. Winkle, Mrs. Cluppins, Sam Weller, one
      after another appearing for a brief interval, and then disappearing for
      ever, each of them a delightfully humorous, one of them in particular, the
      Judge, a simply incomparable impersonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the moment of parting between the great Author and his audience&mdash;that
      last audience who were there as the representatives of his immense public
      in both hemispheres. When the resounding applause that greeted the close
      of that Final Reading had died out, there was a breathless hush as Charles
      Dickens, who had for once lingered there upon the platform, addressed to
      his hearers, with exquisitely clear articulation, but with unmistakably
      profound emotion, these few and simple words of farewell:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen,&mdash;It would be worse than
     &ldquo;idle, for it would be hypocritical and unfeeling, if I
     &ldquo;were to disguise that I close this episode in my life
     &ldquo;with feelings of very considerable pain. For some
     &ldquo;fifteen years in this hall, and in many kindred places,
     &ldquo;I have had the honour of presenting my own che-
     &ldquo;rished ideas before you for your recognition, and in
     &ldquo;closely observing your reception of them have en-
     &ldquo;joyed an amount of artistic delight and instruction,
     &ldquo;which perhaps it is given to few men to know. In
     &ldquo;this task and in every other I have ever undertaken
     &ldquo;as a faithful servant of the public, always imbued
     &ldquo;with the sense of duty to them, and always striving
     &ldquo;to do his best, I have been uniformly cheered by the
     &ldquo;readiest response, the most generous sympathy, and
     &ldquo;the most stimulating support. Nevertheless, I have
     &ldquo;thought it well, at the full flood-tide of your favour,
     &ldquo;to retire upon those older associations between us,
     &ldquo;which date from much further back than these,
     &ldquo;thenceforth to devote myself exclusively to the art
     &ldquo;that first brought us together. Ladies and gentle-
     &ldquo;men, in two short weeks from this time I hope that
     &ldquo;you may enter, in your own homes, on a new series
     &ldquo;of readings at which my assistance will be indispen-
     &ldquo;sable ; but from these garish lights I vanish now for
     &ldquo;evermore, with a heartfelt, grateful, respectful, and
     &ldquo;affectionate fare well.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The manly, cordial voice only faltered once at the very last. The mournful
      modulation of it in the utterance of the words, &ldquo;From these garish lights
      I vanish now for evermore&rdquo; lingers to this moment like a haunting melody
      in our remembrance. Within a few weeks afterwards those very words were
      touchingly inscribed on the Funeral Card distributed at the doors of
      Westminster Abbey on the day of the Novelist's interment in Poet's Corner.
      As he moved from the platform after the utterance of the last words of his
      address and, with his head drooping in emotion, passed behind the screen
      on his way to his retiring-room, a cordial hand was placed for one moment
      with a sympathetic grasp upon his shoulder. The popularity won by Charles
      Dickens, even among the million who never saw him or spoke with him,
      amounted to nothing less than personal affection. Among his friends and
      intimates no great author has ever been more truly or more tenderly
      beloved. The prolonged thunder of applause that followed him to his
      secluded room at the back of the platform, whither he had withdrawn alone,
      recalled him after the lapse of some minutes for another instant into the
      presence of his last audience, from whom, with a kiss of his hand, he then
      indeed parted for evermore.
